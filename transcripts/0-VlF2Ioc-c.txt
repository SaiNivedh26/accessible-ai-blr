[8s-11s] Asalamu alaikum. This is Jri Sama.
[10s-13s] Welcome you all to evening news. You
[11s-15s] have just the crown headlines. Now let's
[13s-17s] move on to the
[15s-19s] details. Chief adviser Professor
[17s-21s] Mohammed Yunus urged the Japanese
[19s-23s] government and entrepreneurs to extend
[21s-25s] their full support in building new
[23s-28s] Bangladesh translating the dreams of
[25s-30s] millions of youths into reality. At a
[28s-32s] business seminar in Tokyo expressing his
[30s-35s] gratitude to Japan for its support in
[32s-37s] developing Maturari, Dr. Yun said it
[35s-40s] laid the foundation of the economy of a
[37s-42s] country that is lagging behind. The
[40s-44s] chief adviser said Bangladesh is the
[42s-47s] doorway for many more millions as people
[44s-49s] of Nepal, Bhutan and the seven sisters
[47s-51s] of India can gain access to the rest of
[49s-54s] the world through Matabari of
[51s-57s] Bangladesh. Later, Dhaka and Tokyo
[54s-59s] signed six MOU on economic investment
[57s-61s] and other cooperation at the seminar.
[59s-64s] The two countries exchanged notes under
[61s-67s] which Tokyo will provide 1 billion USD
[64s-70s] to Taka for budget support, railway
[67s-70s] upgradation and as
[70s-75s] grants. BNP senior leader Misa Abbas has
[73s-78s] accused Dr. from Mohammad Yunus of
[75s-80s] tarnishing the image of BNP during his
[78s-82s] visit to Japan and alleged the chief
[80s-85s] adviser is the only person who does not
[82s-87s] want the national election to happen. He
[85s-89s] made their remarks today after paying
[87s-92s] tributes at the grave of BNP founder and
[89s-95s] martyed president Zia Rahman in Dhaka
[92s-97s] marking his 44th martyr anniversary.
[95s-99s] Senior leaders of the party have raised
[97s-101s] the question of why only the BNP is
[99s-103s] being blamed even though most parties
[101s-106s] have raised demands regarding the
[103s-108s] election. BNP also reiterated its demand
[106s-111s] for the announcement of the election
[108s-111s] road map by
[117s-121s] December.

[157s-161s] Now, sports cricket. The directors of
[159s-163s] the Bangladesh cricket board has elected
[161s-166s] former national cricket team captain
[163s-168s] Amul Islam Bulbull as the president of
[166s-170s] the board. Through the director's vote
[168s-172s] today, Bulbull replaced Faruk Ahmed.
[170s-175s] During an emergency meeting on the day
[172s-178s] at BCB office, Naj Mulabidin Fahim and
[175s-180s] Fahim Sha have been elected senior vice
[178s-182s] president and vice president
[180s-183s] respectively. Earlier on the day
[182s-186s] following the cancellation of Faruk's
[183s-188s] position, the National Sports Council
[186s-191s] officially appointed Bulbull as a
[188s-195s] director of the BISB. The
[191s-197s] NCC issued the notification a day after
[195s-199s] Faruk's position was analled. Following
[197s-202s] a no confidence motion from the a
[199s-204s] directors, the NSA has withdrawn the BCB
[202s-206s] council nomination of Farukq. The
[204s-209s] development comes amid a turbulent
[206s-210s] period in the country's cricket scene,
[209s-212s] especially following the recent
[210s-216s] controversies surrounding players
[212s-216s] payments in the last
[216s-220s] BPL. And that's all from the news for
