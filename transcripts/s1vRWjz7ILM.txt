[1.9s - 10.3s] that hour reached India again
[6.9s - 14.1s] launched missile attacks
[10.3s - 17.4s] bramos and hit Pakistan's various
[14.1s - 21.1s] provinces including airport in Rahul
[17.4s - 21.1s] Pindi and other places
[21.8s - 26.2s] responding to the deadly terror attack
[23.2s - 27.9s] in Pelgam India has struck nine terror
[26.2s - 29.9s] camps across the line of control of the
[27.9s - 32.5s] nine sites that were targeted five were
[29.9s - 35.1s] in PK. Two sites each were in
[32.5s - 37.8s] Muzafarabad and Kotley and one in Pimber
[35.1s - 39.5s] and four in Pakistan's Punjab province.
[37.8s - 41.4s] While India stated that the Pakistani
[39.5s - 43.4s] army was not the target, the Pakistani
[41.4s - 45.4s] army has gone ahead with indiscriminate
[43.4s - 47.9s] attacks that were repelled by India's
[45.4s - 50.9s] air defense systems. Now following this,
[47.9s - 52.6s] New Delhi launched a counter action
[50.9s - 55.8s] carrying out some precision strikes deep
[52.6s - 59.0s] inside Pakistan striking about 11
[55.8s - 60.4s] military targets in Azarban. Pakistani
[59.0s - 62.3s] prime minister was referring to these
[60.4s - 65.0s] strikes. India's decisive action has
[62.3s - 68.5s] prompted Pakistan to seek peace with the
[65.0s - 69.9s] DGMO. The Pakistani initiating the
[68.5s - 71.8s] contact with the Indian side and
[69.9s - 75.0s] agreeing to halt all firing and military
[71.8s - 77.3s] action on land, air and sea which
[75.0s - 79.3s] brought to an end the 4-day long
[77.3s - 81.8s] confrontation.
[79.3s - 83.6s] 22 days after India struck nine terror
[81.8s - 85.6s] camps across the line of control, the
[83.6s - 87.2s] Pakistani prime minister is finally
[85.6s - 89.4s] admitting that his country's armed
[87.2s - 92.2s] forces were caught off guard during
[89.4s - 94.3s] operation Synindhur. During his visit to
[92.2s - 96.5s] Azarbaijan, Shahbash Sharif said that
[94.3s - 99.3s] India hit Pakistan with its brahos
[96.5s - 102.6s] missiles before Pakistani forces could
[99.3s - 106.2s] launch an attack on India.
[102.6s - 109.7s] On 9inth and 10th
[106.2s - 114.2s] night, we decided
[109.7s - 115.6s] to respond in a measured fashion to
[114.2s - 119.8s] Indian
[115.6s - 123.4s] aggression and we had decided that at
[119.8s - 125.1s] 4:30 in the morning after fajar
[123.4s - 127.3s] prayers
[125.1s - 133.3s] Pakistan armed
[127.3s - 137.8s] forces led very aly by our field marshal
[133.3s - 142.7s] Chief Army Staff sitting here say a Asam
[137.8s - 145.6s] Muner to teach a lesson to our
[142.7s - 151.6s] enemy. But
[145.6s - 155.1s] before that hour reached, India again
[151.6s - 158.9s] launched missile attacks
[155.1s - 162.2s] bramos and hit Pakistan's various
[158.9s - 165.6s] provinces including airport in Rahul
[162.2s - 167.4s] Pindi and other places.
[165.6s - 169.6s] Responding to the deadly terror attack
[167.4s - 171.7s] in Pahhelgam, India struck nine terror
[169.6s - 173.8s] camps across the line of control. Of the
[171.7s - 176.4s] nine sites that were targeted, five were
[173.8s - 179.2s] in Pakistan occupied Kashmir, two sides
[176.4s - 181.4s] each were in Muzafurabad and Kley and
[179.2s - 183.2s] one in Bimbear and four in Pakistan's
[181.4s - 185.4s] Punjab
[183.2s - 187.4s] province. While India stated that
[185.4s - 189.2s] Pakistan army was not the target, the
[187.4s - 191.2s] Pakistan army went ahead with
[189.2s - 193.8s] indiscriminate attacks that were
[191.2s - 195.8s] repelled by India's air defense systems.
[193.8s - 197.5s] Now following this, New Delhi launched a
[195.8s - 200.4s] counter action carrying out precision
[197.5s - 202.4s] strikes deep inside Pakistan striking 11
[200.4s - 205.0s] military
[202.4s - 206.6s] targets. In Azabaijan, the Pakistani
[205.0s - 209.0s] prime minister was referring to these
[206.6s - 211.4s] strikes. India's decisive action
[209.0s - 213.8s] prompted Pakistan to seek peace with the
[211.4s - 216.3s] DGM of Pakistan initiating contact with
[213.8s - 218.2s] the Indian side and agreeing to halt all
[216.3s - 220.6s] firing and military action on land, air,
[218.2s - 221.8s] and sea, bringing an end to a three-day
[220.6s - 223.6s] long
[221.8s - 224.6s] confrontation. All right. We'll of
[223.6s - 226.1s] course continue to bring all
[224.6s - 228.2s] developments on that front. Let's shift
[226.1s - 229.9s] our focus for now. Pakistan's Prime
[228.2s - 232.0s] Minister Shahbas Sharif has admitted to
[229.9s - 234.9s] India's precision missile strike on the
[232.0s - 237.1s] Nuran air base in Rahul Pindi and other
[234.9s - 239.6s] sites. In a statement that has now gone
[237.1s - 242.5s] viral on social media, Sharif is heard
[239.6s - 244.6s] saying that Pakistan army chief Aimuner
[242.5s - 246.5s] personally called him at 2:30 a.m. on
[244.6s - 249.0s] the intervening night of the 9th of May
[246.5s - 252.3s] and the 10th of May to inform him about
[249.0s - 252.3s] the attack.
[260.4s - 264.3s] Nori General
[276.7s - 280.8s] says report.
[283.3s - 287.6s] The Pakistani prime minister made the
[285.0s - 289.9s] admission while addressing the Yom
[287.6s - 292.8s] Tashakur event in the Pakist at the
[289.9s - 295.1s] Pakistan monument in
[292.8s - 297.2s] Islamabad. India's counter strike it
[295.1s - 299.9s] targeted key Pakistani air bases
[297.2s - 303.8s] including Nur Khan, Rahheimar Khan,
[299.9s - 306.8s] Walari, Jakobabad, Scardu and Saroda.
[303.8s - 308.7s] These bases suffered extensive damage as
[306.8s - 311.6s] confirmed by satellite images released
[308.7s - 313.9s] by the Indian military. Satellite images
[311.6s - 316.4s] released by Maxar Technologies confirmed
[313.9s - 318.4s] attacks by the Indian armed forces. The
[316.4s - 321.0s] damage to Pakistani military facilities
[318.4s - 324.0s] have been devastating after crossber
[321.0s - 325.6s] strikes from India. Pakistan has made a
[324.0s - 327.2s] rare acknowledgement of its military
[325.6s - 329.3s] losses. Pakistan's Prime Minister
[327.2s - 331.8s] Shabbash Sharif has admitted India's
[329.3s - 334.2s] precision missile strikes on the Nurh
[331.8s - 336.5s] Khan air base in Rahul Pindi and other
[334.2s - 338.9s] sides. The Shabbash Sharif revealed that
[336.5s - 341.2s] Pakistan's army chief Aimuner had
[338.9s - 343.8s] personally called him at 2:30 a.m. on
[341.2s - 346.1s] the intervening night of the 9th of May
[343.8s - 349.1s] and 10th to inform him about the attack.
[346.1s - 349.1s] Listen.
[358.9s - 361.8s] General
[370.0s - 377.2s] say, ballistic missiles
[374.2s - 377.2s] launch
[380.2s - 385.0s] airport as part of operations. Synindur
[382.6s - 387.0s] the Indian air force the Indian Navy had
[385.0s - 388.6s] worked in tandem to strike a terror
[387.0s - 390.3s] infrastructure and strategic military
[388.6s - 392.8s] installations across Pakistan and
[390.3s - 394.5s] Pakistan occupied Kashmir. In the
[392.8s - 395.8s] aftermath of operation Synindur, India
[394.5s - 397.9s] is of course continuing its fight
[395.8s - 399.9s] against Pakistan sponsored terror in its
[397.9s - 402.6s] latest crackdown on Pakistani spies and
[399.9s - 405.6s] sleeper cells. Six Indian nationals have
[402.6s - 407.2s] been arrested for spying for Pakistan.
[405.6s - 409.8s] Now, those arrested for sharing
[407.2s - 412.2s] sensitive information includes a Hanaab
[409.8s - 416.4s] based YouTuber and a travel blogger
[412.2s - 418.7s] called Joti Malhotra. The 33-year-old
[416.4s - 421.4s] YouTuber reportedly ran a travel account
[418.7s - 424.8s] named Travel with Joe. She's now been
[421.4s - 427.0s] arrested from Hisar in Hana for sharing
[424.8s - 430.0s] what has been described as sensitive
[427.0s - 431.9s] military information with Pakistan. She
[430.0s - 435.4s] allegedly had developed close ties with
[431.9s - 437.0s] Easan Rahman Rahim alias Danish a staff
[435.4s - 439.1s] member at the Pakistani high commission
[437.0s - 441.6s] in New Delhi during her visit to
[439.1s - 443.8s] Pakistan. Now the accused is amongst the
[441.6s - 445.8s] six people including a 25-year-old
[443.8s - 448.8s] student and 24 yearear-old security
[445.8s - 451.2s] guard from Punjab who had been who have
[448.8s - 453.6s] been arrested on these charges. The
[451.2s - 455.9s] India has also busted a massive fake SIM
[453.6s - 457.1s] racket with Pakistani links under
[455.9s - 460.0s] operation
[457.1s - 463.6s] ghost sim Indian officials have traced
[460.0s - 466.1s] fake SIM card rackets across India and
[463.6s - 468.3s] they have so far made seven arrests from
[466.1s - 470.6s] three different states. Now India's
[468.3s - 472.4s] state investigation agency is currently
[470.6s - 475.2s] conducting raids at multiple locations
[472.4s - 476.6s] across central and north India. The
[475.2s - 478.1s] development follows the recent
[476.6s - 481.1s] documented raids that have been carried
[478.1s - 483.8s] out by the SIA on the 11th of May
[481.1s - 485.4s] targeting approximately 20 locations in
[483.8s - 488.4s] South Kashmir specifically in the
[485.4s - 490.4s] districts of Pulwama, Chopan, Kulgam and
[488.4s - 493.2s] also
[490.4s - 495.7s] Anunag and Pakistan Prime Minister Shah
[493.2s - 497.6s] Sharif has admitted that he was swimming
[495.7s - 500.0s] while India launched precision strikes
[497.6s - 502.2s] on Pakistan under operation Synindhur.
[500.0s - 504.1s] In a statement at an event in Islamabad
[502.2s - 506.6s] on Friday, the Pakistan Prime Minister
[504.1s - 508.5s] said he received a call from General Sed
[506.6s - 510.9s] Aimunir around 2:30 a.m. on the
[508.5s - 513.2s] intervening night on May 9th and May
[510.9s - 515.6s] 10th, adding that he was informed that
[513.2s - 518.1s] India's ballistic missiles had hit Nuran
[515.6s - 519.6s] air base and other areas. A Sharif
[518.1s - 521.5s] further went on to say that he was
[519.6s - 526.1s] swimming when he received the secure
[521.5s - 526.1s] line call from army chief Aimuner.
[546.3s - 550.2s] foreign. As luck would have
[554.9s - 559.5s] it, the controversial statement of
[557.4s - 561.8s] Shahash Sharif inadvertently admitting
[559.5s - 564.3s] to the strikes has drawn massive flag
[561.8s - 565.8s] from Pakistani citizens on social media.
[564.3s - 567.9s] India strikes in retaliation to the
[565.8s - 570.6s] pelgam terror attack targeted key
[567.9s - 573.9s] Pakistani air bases including Nurhan,
[570.6s - 575.9s] Rahim Yar Khan, Malor, Jakobabad, Sakadu
[573.9s - 577.7s] and Sarugda. Well, as confirmed by
[575.9s - 580.0s] satellite images released by the Indian
[577.7s - 582.5s] military, the military bases in Pakistan
[580.0s - 584.6s] suffered extensive damage. Satellite
[582.5s - 586.4s] images released by Maxa Technologies
[584.6s - 588.7s] confirmed attacks by the Indian armed
[586.4s - 591.2s] forces. The damage to Pakistani military
[588.7s - 594.1s] facilities have been devastating after
[591.2s - 595.9s] crossber strikes from India. In other
[594.1s - 598.5s] news, weeks after India conducted
[595.9s - 601.0s] precision military strikes on Pakistan's
[598.5s - 603.8s] terror hubs in response to the Pelgam
[601.0s - 606.7s] terror attack, Pakistan cries talks
[603.8s - 610.2s] again. Pakistan's Prime Minister Shabbaz
[606.7s - 613.1s] Sharif has reportedly extended India an
[610.2s - 617.0s] olive branch. But going by past
[613.1s - 620.2s] experiences, if broken promises at talks
[617.0s - 624.1s] and dialogue had a face, there's few
[620.2s - 626.3s] more diabolical than Islamabad. Let's
[624.1s - 628.8s] break that down for you. During his
[626.3s - 631.4s] visit to Iran, Pakistan's Prime Minister
[628.8s - 634.3s] Shabbah Sharif said that he was ready to
[631.4s - 636.6s] engage in peace talks with India.
[634.3s - 639.3s] He even stressed on the importance of
[636.6s - 641.8s] dialogue to resolve outstanding disputes
[639.3s - 644.7s] and he has touched on a couple that have
[641.8s - 647.4s] troubled bilateral ties for decades.
[644.7s - 649.6s] Number one, Kashmir, a major flash point
[647.4s - 652.9s] between the neighbors. Number two,
[649.6s - 655.4s] terrorism. Water sharing and trade were
[652.9s - 657.9s] some of the others that the Pakistan
[655.4s - 659.7s] prime minister listed out. Shar's
[657.9s - 662.5s] remarks came weeks after India and
[659.7s - 665.0s] Pakistan agreed to military ceasefires.
[662.5s - 667.6s] Speaking to media in Thran, Sharif
[665.0s - 670.5s] signaled Islamabad's willingness to
[667.6s - 673.5s] pursue peace and diplomatic engagement
[670.5s - 677.4s] with India. A distinct shift from the
[673.5s - 680.2s] hostile tone taken earlier. However,
[677.4s - 682.0s] there were no missing the rider. Listen
[680.2s - 683.3s] to what the Pakistan prime minister
[682.0s - 685.5s] said.
[683.3s - 689.4s] We are ready to
[685.5s - 689.4s] talk for the sake of
[690.0s - 697.8s] peace on water issue with our
[695.1s - 701.6s] neighbor. We are ready to talk to
[697.8s - 703.5s] promote trade and
[701.6s - 707.2s] also
[703.5s - 711.2s] counterterrorism if they are
[707.2s - 714.6s] serious. But if they choose to to remain
[711.2s - 716.8s] aggressor then we shall defend our
[714.6s - 719.7s] territory and our
[716.8s - 722.9s] country like we have
[719.7s - 725.6s] done. Clearly Sharif seems interested in
[722.9s - 728.7s] settling scores with New Delhi but with
[725.6s - 732.0s] a condition or rather a subdued threat
[728.7s - 735.0s] of sorts. Accept the offer for peace or
[732.0s - 737.6s] be ready for war. India has responded
[735.0s - 740.0s] firmly and in a discreet manner. Prime
[737.6s - 742.2s] Minister Narendra Modi has made it
[740.0s - 745.4s] extremely clear, crystal clear that
[742.2s - 747.0s] terror and talks cannot go hand in hand.
[745.4s - 749.2s] Prime Minister Modi said any dialogue
[747.0s - 751.8s] with Pakistan will be limited to the
[749.2s - 755.4s] return of Pakistan occupied Kashmir and
[751.8s - 757.4s] the issue of terrorism only. Addressing
[755.4s - 759.9s] an event in the Indian state of Gujarat,
[757.4s - 762.2s] Prime Minister Modi said Pakistan had
[759.9s - 765.0s] shown clear backing for terrorist
[762.2s - 768.6s] elements during operation Sindur with
[765.0s - 768.6s] proof loud and clear.
[789.4s - 793.0s] State owner
[794.3s - 797.9s] Pakistan coffin
[802.1s - 806.1s] Pakistan salute.
[829.8s - 832.9s] similar proof was put forth from the
[831.4s - 834.8s] Indian side as well. One that
[832.9s - 838.1s] established the success of its
[834.8s - 840.4s] retaliatory strike operation Synindhur.
[838.1s - 843.0s] In a newly released video by India's
[840.4s - 845.6s] Border Security Force of BSF, Prime
[843.0s - 848.6s] Minister Modi termed it decisive action
[845.6s - 853.6s] and strong reflection of India's zero
[848.6s - 853.6s] tolerance for any form of terror.
[868.5s - 871.7s] [Music]
[878.2s - 883.2s] India and Pakistan have shared a
[880.3s - 885.2s] troubled relationship since 1947. That's
[883.2s - 887.4s] the year of partition. Since then, both
[885.2s - 890.5s] India and Pakistan have fought multiple
[887.4s - 894.0s] wars. But when it comes to Islamabad,
[890.5s - 896.7s] old habits die hard, thus rendering past
[894.0s - 899.2s] talks pretty much meaningless and
[896.7s - 902.8s] leaving the prospect of peace rather
[899.2s - 905.1s] elusive. In October 1947, the first war
[902.8s - 908.8s] over Kashmir broke out and continued
[905.1s - 912.1s] until 1948 when Kashmir was divided.
[908.8s - 915.4s] Eventually failed talks led to a second
[912.1s - 917.6s] war in 1960s which is also when India
[915.4s - 921.2s] and Pakistan signed the Indis waters
[917.6s - 923.3s] treaty in 1963. Talks were held once
[921.2s - 926.6s] again over the disputed territory of
[923.3s - 929.5s] Kashmir mediated by the US and the UK.
[926.6s - 933.6s] However, no agreement was reached even
[929.5s - 936.5s] then. In 1965, the two countries fought
[933.6s - 939.8s] the second war over Kashmir. One which
[936.5s - 942.6s] ended inconclusively with a ceasefire.
[939.8s - 944.4s] In 1971, the Indian army's involvement
[942.6s - 947.2s] in the Bangladesh liberation war
[944.4s - 950.2s] culminated in the similar agreement in
[947.2s - 954.0s] 1972 where both sides agreed to settle
[950.2s - 955.9s] any disputes by peaceful means. There
[954.0s - 958.6s] have been many more rounds of talks
[955.9s - 961.6s] after that all with limited success
[958.6s - 964.6s] because they were thwarted each time by
[961.6s - 967.7s] repeated acts of terror and crossber
[964.6s - 970.9s] violations by Pakistan. And not just
[967.7s - 973.4s] that, the fact that the peace talks did
[970.9s - 976.3s] not materialize is evident in the spate
[973.4s - 979.0s] of terror attacks that ensued such as
[976.3s - 981.4s] the December 2001 attack on the Indian
[979.0s - 984.9s] Parliament in New Delhi that killed 14
[981.4s - 987.0s] people. Then in November 2008, armed
[984.9s - 990.3s] gunmen opened fire on civilians at
[987.0s - 993.2s] several sites in Mumbai, killing over
[990.3s - 995.8s] 150. Even as trade relations began to
[993.2s - 998.6s] improve across the LOC and more
[995.8s - 1001.8s] recently, talks were also initiated in
[998.6s - 1005.2s] the aftermath of the 2016 Uri attacks
[1001.8s - 1008.0s] and Pulwama attacks in 2019. But
[1005.2s - 1010.4s] unfortunately, not to much avail. And
[1008.0s - 1012.7s] finally, the Pelgam terror attack on the
[1010.4s - 1015.4s] 22nd of April this year, which capped
[1012.7s - 1018.7s] all previous attacks for its mode of
[1015.4s - 1021.5s] warfare. A dastardly attack on civilians
[1018.7s - 1024.2s] and a clear message to India that
[1021.5s - 1028.1s] Islamabad never did and perhaps never
[1024.2s - 1030.9s] will roll back its terror machine. Now,
[1028.1s - 1032.3s] 22 days after India struck nine terror
[1030.9s - 1034.1s] camps across the line of control, the
[1032.3s - 1035.9s] Pakistani prime minister is admitting
[1034.1s - 1037.7s] that his country's armed forces were
[1035.9s - 1040.2s] caught off guard.
[1037.7s - 1042.0s] during operation Synindhub. Now during
[1040.2s - 1043.6s] his visit to Azarbaran, Shabbah Sharif
[1042.0s - 1046.2s] has said that India hit Pakistan with
[1043.6s - 1048.8s] its brahos missiles before the Pakistani
[1046.2s - 1050.7s] forces could even launch an attack on
[1048.8s - 1055.5s] India. Isn't
[1050.7s - 1059.0s] it? On ninth and 10th
[1055.5s - 1063.5s] night, we decided
[1059.0s - 1064.8s] to respond in a measured fashion to
[1063.5s - 1069.0s] Indian
[1064.8s - 1072.7s] aggression and we had decided that at
[1069.0s - 1074.4s] 4:30 in the morning after fajal
[1072.7s - 1076.6s] prayers
[1074.4s - 1080.6s] Pakistan armed
[1076.6s - 1082.6s] forces led very abley by our field
[1080.6s - 1087.0s] marshal
[1082.6s - 1091.9s] Chief Army Staff sitting here say
[1087.0s - 1094.9s] Ashimir to teach a lesson to our
[1091.9s - 1100.9s] enemy. But
[1094.9s - 1104.4s] before that hour reached, India again
[1100.9s - 1108.1s] launched missile attacks
[1104.4s - 1111.4s] Bramos and hit Pakistan's various
[1108.1s - 1114.2s] provinces including airport in Rahul
[1111.4s - 1114.2s] Pindi and other
[1114.5s - 1119.8s] places. Responding to the deadly terror
[1117.0s - 1121.7s] attack in Pelgam, India has struck nine
[1119.8s - 1123.4s] terror camps across the line of control.
[1121.7s - 1126.5s] Of the nine sites that were targeted,
[1123.4s - 1129.2s] five were in PK. Two sites each were in
[1126.5s - 1131.9s] Muzafarabad and Kley and one in Pimber
[1129.2s - 1133.5s] and four in Pakistan's Punjab province.
[1131.9s - 1135.4s] While India stated that the Pakistani
[1133.5s - 1137.4s] army was not the target. The Pakistani
[1135.4s - 1139.4s] army has gone ahead with indiscriminate
[1137.4s - 1142.0s] attacks that were repelled by India's
[1139.4s - 1144.9s] air defense systems. Now following this,
[1142.0s - 1146.7s] New Delhi launched a counter action
[1144.9s - 1149.8s] carrying out some precision strikes deep
[1146.7s - 1152.6s] inside Pakistan striking about 11
[1149.8s - 1154.0s] military targets. In Azharban, the
[1152.6s - 1155.9s] Pakistani prime minister was referring
[1154.0s - 1157.8s] to these strikes. India's decisive
[1155.9s - 1161.7s] action has prompted Pakistan to seek
[1157.8s - 1163.4s] peace with the DGMO. The Pakistani
[1161.7s - 1165.5s] initiating the contact with the Indian
[1163.4s - 1168.7s] side and agreeing to halt all firing and
[1165.5s - 1171.3s] military action on land, air and sea
[1168.7s - 1173.3s] which brought to an end the 4-day long
[1171.3s - 1175.8s] confrontation.
[1173.3s - 1177.6s] 22 days after India struck nine terror
[1175.8s - 1179.6s] camps across the line of control. The
[1177.6s - 1181.3s] Pakistani prime minister is finally
[1179.6s - 1183.5s] admitting that his country's armed
[1181.3s - 1186.2s] forces were caught off guard during
[1183.5s - 1188.3s] operation Synindur. During his visit to
[1186.2s - 1190.6s] Azarbaijan, Shabbash Sharif said that
[1188.3s - 1193.3s] India hit Pakistan with its Brahmos
[1190.6s - 1196.7s] missiles before Pakistani forces could
[1193.3s - 1200.3s] launch an attack on India.
[1196.7s - 1203.8s] On ninth and 10th
[1200.3s - 1208.2s] night we decided
[1203.8s - 1209.6s] to respond in a measured fashion to
[1208.2s - 1213.8s] Indian
[1209.6s - 1217.5s] aggression and we had decided that at
[1213.8s - 1219.1s] 4:30 in the morning after fajal
[1217.5s - 1221.4s] prayers
[1219.1s - 1225.4s] Pakistan armed
[1221.4s - 1227.4s] forces led very abley by our field
[1225.4s - 1231.8s] marshal
[1227.4s - 1236.7s] chief army staff sitting here say
[1231.8s - 1239.7s] aim to teach a lesson to our
[1236.7s - 1245.7s] enemy. But
[1239.7s - 1249.1s] before that hour reached, India again
[1245.7s - 1252.9s] launched missile attacks
[1249.1s - 1256.2s] Bramos and hit Pakistan's various
[1252.9s - 1259.7s] provinces including airport in Rahul
[1256.2s - 1261.4s] Pindi and other places.
[1259.7s - 1263.6s] Responding to the deadly terror attack
[1261.4s - 1265.7s] in Pahelgam, India struck nine terror
[1263.6s - 1267.8s] camps across the line of control. Of the
[1265.7s - 1270.4s] nine sites that were targeted, five were
[1267.8s - 1273.2s] in Pakistan occupied Kashmir, two sides
[1270.4s - 1275.4s] each were in Musafarabad and Kotley and
[1273.2s - 1277.2s] one in Bhimir and four in Pakistan's
[1275.4s - 1279.4s] Punjab
[1277.2s - 1281.4s] province. While India stated that
[1279.4s - 1283.3s] Pakistan army was not the target, the
[1281.4s - 1285.2s] Pakistan army went ahead with
[1283.3s - 1287.8s] indiscriminate attacks that were
[1285.2s - 1289.8s] repelled by India's air defense systems.
[1287.8s - 1291.5s] Now following this, New Delhi launched a
[1289.8s - 1294.1s] counter action carrying out precision
[1291.5s - 1296.4s] strikes deep inside Pakistan, striking
[1294.1s - 1299.3s] 11 military
[1296.4s - 1301.6s] targets. In Azaban, the Pakistani prime
[1299.3s - 1303.5s] minister was referring to these strikes.
[1301.6s - 1306.1s] India's decisive action prompted
[1303.5s - 1308.0s] Pakistan to seek peace with the DGM of
[1306.1s - 1310.3s] Pakistan initiating contact with the
[1308.0s - 1312.3s] Indian side and agreeing to halt all
[1310.3s - 1314.7s] firing and military action on land, air,
[1312.3s - 1316.9s] and sea, bringing an end to a three-day
[1314.7s - 1318.3s] long confrontation.
[1316.9s - 1319.8s] All right, we'll of course continue to
[1318.3s - 1321.3s] bring all developments on that front.
[1319.8s - 1323.0s] Let's shift our focus for now.
[1321.3s - 1324.9s] Pakistan's Prime Minister Shahbash
[1323.0s - 1327.2s] Sharif has admitted to India's precision
[1324.9s - 1330.1s] missile strike on the Nuran air base in
[1327.2s - 1331.8s] Rahul Pindi and other sites. In a
[1330.1s - 1333.8s] statement that has now gone viral on
[1331.8s - 1336.5s] social media. Sharif is heard saying
[1333.8s - 1338.6s] that Pakistan army chief Aimuner
[1336.5s - 1340.6s] personally called him at 2:30 a.m. on
[1338.6s - 1343.1s] the intervening night of the 9th of May
[1340.6s - 1346.4s] and the 10th of May to inform him about
[1343.1s - 1346.4s] the attack.
[1354.4s - 1357.4s] nor
[1363.6s - 1370.1s] General
[1366.6s - 1370.1s] Hindustan ballistic
[1370.7s - 1374.8s] missile airport.
[1377.3s - 1381.7s] The Pakistani prime minister made the
[1379.0s - 1384.0s] admission while addressing the Yom
[1381.7s - 1386.8s] Tashakur event in the Pakist at the
[1384.0s - 1389.1s] Pakistan monument in
[1386.8s - 1391.3s] Islamabad. India's counter strike it
[1389.1s - 1394.0s] targeted key Pakistani air bases
[1391.3s - 1397.8s] including Nurh Khan, Raheimar Khan,
[1394.0s - 1400.8s] Balari, Jakobabad, Scardu and Sarodora.
[1397.8s - 1402.7s] These bases suffered extensive damage as
[1400.8s - 1405.6s] confirmed by satellite images released
[1402.7s - 1407.9s] by the Indian military. Satellite images
[1405.6s - 1410.4s] released by Maxar Technologies confirmed
[1407.9s - 1412.4s] attacks by the Indian armed forces. The
[1410.4s - 1415.0s] damage to Pakistani military facilities
[1412.4s - 1418.0s] have been devastating after crossber
[1415.0s - 1419.7s] strikes from India. Pakistan has made a
[1418.0s - 1421.3s] rare acknowledgement of its military
[1419.7s - 1423.3s] losses. Pakistan's Prime Minister
[1421.3s - 1425.8s] Shabbah Sharif has admitted India's
[1423.3s - 1428.2s] precision missile strikes on the Nurh
[1425.8s - 1430.6s] Khan air base in Rahul Pindi and other
[1428.2s - 1432.9s] sides. The Shabbash Sharif revealed that
[1430.6s - 1435.3s] Pakistan's army chief Aimuner had
[1432.9s - 1437.8s] personally called him at 2:30 a.m. on
[1435.3s - 1440.2s] the intervening night of the 9th of May
[1437.8s - 1443.2s] and 10th to inform him about the attack.
[1440.2s - 1443.2s] Listen.
[1453.0s - 1455.8s] General
[1464.1s - 1471.2s] say, ballistic missiles
[1468.2s - 1471.2s] launch
[1474.2s - 1479.0s] airport as part of operations. Synindur
[1476.7s - 1481.0s] the Indian air force the Indian Navy had
[1479.0s - 1482.6s] worked in tandem to strike a terror
[1481.0s - 1484.3s] infrastructure and strategic military
[1482.6s - 1486.8s] installations across Pakistan and
[1484.3s - 1488.5s] Pakistan occupied Kashmir. In the
[1486.8s - 1489.8s] aftermath of operation Synindhur, India
[1488.5s - 1492.0s] is of course continuing its fight
[1489.8s - 1494.0s] against Pakistan sponsored terror in its
[1492.0s - 1496.6s] latest crackdown on Pakistani spies and
[1494.0s - 1499.6s] sleeper cells. Six Indian nationals have
[1496.6s - 1501.2s] been arrested for spying for Pakistan.
[1499.6s - 1503.9s] Now, those arrested for sharing
[1501.2s - 1506.2s] sensitive information includes a Hanaab
[1503.9s - 1510.5s] based YouTuber and a travel blogger
[1506.2s - 1512.8s] called Joti Malhotra. The 33-year-old
[1510.5s - 1515.5s] YouTuber reportedly ran a travel account
[1512.8s - 1518.9s] named Travel with Joe. She's now been
[1515.5s - 1521.0s] arrested from Hisar in Hana for sharing
[1518.9s - 1524.1s] what is being described as sensitive
[1521.0s - 1526.0s] military information with Pakistan. She
[1524.1s - 1529.1s] allegedly had developed close ties with
[1526.0s - 1530.7s] Easan Rahman Raheem alias Dhanish a
[1529.1s - 1533.0s] staff member the Pakistani high
[1530.7s - 1535.4s] commission in New Delhi during her visit
[1533.0s - 1537.8s] to Pakistan. Now the accused is amongst
[1535.4s - 1539.8s] the six people including a 25-year-old
[1537.8s - 1542.8s] student and 24 yearear-old security
[1539.8s - 1545.3s] guard from Punjab who had been who have
[1542.8s - 1547.7s] been arrested on these charges. Now
[1545.3s - 1549.9s] India has also busted a massive fake SIM
[1547.7s - 1551.2s] racket with Pakistani links under
[1549.9s - 1554.0s] operation
[1551.2s - 1557.6s] ghost sim Indian officials have traced
[1554.0s - 1560.1s] fake SIM card rackets across India and
[1557.6s - 1562.4s] they have so far made seven arrests from
[1560.1s - 1564.6s] three different states. Now India's
[1562.4s - 1566.4s] state investigation agency is currently
[1564.6s - 1569.2s] conducting raids at multiple locations
[1566.4s - 1570.6s] across central and north India. The
[1569.2s - 1572.2s] development follows the recent
[1570.6s - 1575.2s] documented raids that have been carried
[1572.2s - 1577.8s] out by the SIA on the 11th of May
[1575.2s - 1579.4s] targeting approximately 20 locations in
[1577.8s - 1582.2s] South Kashmir specifically in the
[1579.4s - 1585.4s] districts of Pulwama, Chopyan, Kulgam
[1582.2s - 1587.6s] and also Anundant Nag
[1585.4s - 1590.1s] and Pakistan Prime Minister Shah Sharif
[1587.6s - 1591.9s] has admitted that he was swimming while
[1590.1s - 1594.4s] India launched precision strikes on
[1591.9s - 1596.4s] Pakistan under operation Sindur. In a
[1594.4s - 1598.7s] statement at an event in Islamabad on
[1596.4s - 1601.3s] Friday, the Pakistan Prime Minister said
[1598.7s - 1603.0s] he received a call from General Sedimir
[1601.3s - 1605.9s] around 2:30 a.m. on the intervening
[1603.0s - 1607.7s] night on May 9th and May 10th, adding
[1605.9s - 1609.8s] that he was informed that India's
[1607.7s - 1612.3s] ballistic missiles had hit Nuran air
[1609.8s - 1614.5s] base and other areas. Now Shari further
[1612.3s - 1616.4s] went on to say that he was swimming when
[1614.5s - 1620.1s] he received the secure line call from
[1616.4s - 1620.1s] Army Chief Aimuner.
[1640.4s - 1645.3s] foreign as luck would have it.
[1650.1s - 1653.8s] The controversial statement of Shahabas
[1652.0s - 1656.1s] Sharif inadvertently admitting to the
[1653.8s - 1658.3s] strikes has drawn massive flag from
[1656.1s - 1659.9s] Pakistani citizens on social media.
[1658.3s - 1661.9s] India strikes in retaliation to the
[1659.9s - 1664.6s] Pahelgam terror attack targeted key
[1661.9s - 1667.9s] Pakistani air bases including Nurh Khan,
[1664.6s - 1670.0s] Rahim Yar Khan, Malor, Jakobabad, Sakadu
[1667.9s - 1671.8s] and Sarugda. While as confirmed by
[1670.0s - 1674.1s] satellite images released by the Indian
[1671.8s - 1676.5s] military, the military bases in Pakistan
[1674.1s - 1678.6s] suffered extensive damage. Satellite
[1676.5s - 1680.4s] images released by Maxa Technologies
[1678.6s - 1682.8s] confirmed attacks by the Indian armed
[1680.4s - 1685.2s] forces. The damage to Pakistani military
[1682.8s - 1688.1s] facilities have been devastating after
[1685.2s - 1690.0s] crossber strikes from India. In other
[1688.1s - 1692.5s] news, weeks after India conducted
[1690.0s - 1695.0s] precision military strikes on Pakistan's
[1692.5s - 1697.9s] terror hubs in response to the pelgam
[1695.0s - 1700.7s] terror attack, Pakistan cries talks
[1697.9s - 1704.2s] again. Pakistan's Prime Minister Shabbaz
[1700.7s - 1707.1s] Sharif has reportedly extended India an
[1704.2s - 1711.0s] olive branch. But going by past
[1707.1s - 1714.3s] experiences, if broken promises at talks
[1711.0s - 1718.1s] and dialogue had a face, there's few
[1714.3s - 1720.4s] more diabolical than Islamabad. Let's
[1718.1s - 1722.9s] break that down for you. During his
[1720.4s - 1725.5s] visit to Iran, Pakistan's Prime Minister
[1722.9s - 1728.6s] Shabbah Sharif said that he was ready to
[1725.5s - 1730.6s] engage in peace talks with India. He
[1728.6s - 1733.4s] even stressed on the importance of
[1730.6s - 1735.8s] dialogue to resolve outstanding disputes
[1733.4s - 1738.7s] and he has touched on a couple that have
[1735.8s - 1741.4s] troubled bilateral ties for decades.
[1738.7s - 1743.7s] Number one, Kashmir, a major flash point
[1741.4s - 1746.9s] between the neighbors. Number two,
[1743.7s - 1749.4s] terrorism. Water sharing and trade were
[1746.9s - 1752.0s] some of the others that the Pakistan
[1749.4s - 1753.7s] prime minister listed out. Sharif's
[1752.0s - 1756.5s] remarks came weeks after India and
[1753.7s - 1759.0s] Pakistan agreed to military ceasefires.
[1756.5s - 1761.7s] Speaking to media in Thran, Sharif
[1759.0s - 1764.6s] signaled Islamabad's willingness to
[1761.7s - 1767.6s] pursue peace and diplomatic engagement
[1764.6s - 1771.4s] with India. A distinct shift from the
[1767.6s - 1774.2s] hostile tone taken earlier. However,
[1771.4s - 1776.0s] there were no missing the rider. Listen
[1774.2s - 1777.4s] to what the Pakistan prime minister
[1776.0s - 1779.6s] said.
[1777.4s - 1783.4s] We are ready to
[1779.6s - 1783.4s] talk for the sake of
[1784.1s - 1791.9s] peace on water issue with our
[1789.1s - 1792.8s] neighbor. We are ready to talk to
[1791.9s - 1795.6s] promote
[1792.8s - 1797.6s] trade and
[1795.6s - 1802.4s] also
[1797.6s - 1806.1s] counterterrorism if they are serious.
[1802.4s - 1806.1s] But if they choose to to remain
[1810.8s - 1816.9s] aggress like we have done.
[1814.8s - 1819.7s] Clearly Sharif seems interested in
[1816.9s - 1822.8s] settling scores with New Delhi but with
[1819.7s - 1826.0s] a condition or rather a subdued threat
[1822.8s - 1829.0s] of sorts. Accept the offer for peace or
[1826.0s - 1831.6s] be ready for war. India has responded
[1829.0s - 1834.1s] firmly and in a discreet manner. Prime
[1831.6s - 1836.2s] Minister Narendra Modi has made it
[1834.1s - 1839.4s] extremely clear, crystal clear that
[1836.2s - 1841.1s] terror and talks cannot go hand in hand.
[1839.4s - 1843.3s] Prime Minister Modi said any dialogue
[1841.1s - 1845.8s] with Pakistan will be limited to the
[1843.3s - 1849.4s] return of Pakistan occupied Kashmir and
[1845.8s - 1851.5s] the issue of terrorism only. Addressing
[1849.4s - 1854.0s] an event in the Indian state of Gujarat,
[1851.5s - 1856.2s] Prime Minister Modi said Pakistan had
[1854.0s - 1859.0s] shown clear backing for terrorist
[1856.2s - 1862.6s] elements during operation Sindur with
[1859.0s - 1862.6s] proof loud and clear.
[1883.4s - 1887.1s] State owner
[1888.4s - 1892.0s] Pakistan coffin
[1896.1s - 1900.1s] Pakistan salute.
[1923.8s - 1927.0s] similar proof was put forth from the
[1925.4s - 1928.9s] Indian side as well. One that
[1927.0s - 1932.1s] established the success of its
[1928.9s - 1934.5s] retaliatory strike operation Synindur.
[1932.1s - 1937.0s] In a newly released video by India's
[1934.5s - 1939.7s] Border Security Force of BSF, Prime
[1937.0s - 1942.6s] Minister Modi termed it decisive action
[1939.7s - 1947.6s] and strong reflection of India's zero
[1942.6s - 1947.6s] tolerance for any form of terror.
[1962.5s - 1965.8s] [Music]
[1972.2s - 1977.2s] India and Pakistan have shared a
[1974.4s - 1979.2s] troubled relationship since 1947. That's
[1977.2s - 1981.4s] the year of partition. Since then, both
[1979.2s - 1984.5s] India and Pakistan have fought multiple
[1981.4s - 1988.0s] wars. But when it comes to Islamabad,
[1984.5s - 1990.7s] old habits die hard, thus rendering past
[1988.0s - 1993.2s] talks pretty much meaningless and
[1990.7s - 1996.8s] leaving the prospect of peace rather
[1993.2s - 1999.1s] elusive. In October 1947, the first war
[1996.8s - 2002.8s] over Kashmir broke out and continued
[1999.1s - 2006.1s] until 1948 when Kashmir was divided.
[2002.8s - 2009.5s] Eventually failed talks led to a second
[2006.1s - 2011.6s] war in 1960s which is also when India
[2009.5s - 2015.2s] and Pakistan signed the Indis waters
[2011.6s - 2017.4s] treaty in 1963. Talks were held once
[2015.2s - 2020.6s] again over the disputed territory of
[2017.4s - 2023.6s] Kashmir mediated by the US and the UK.
[2020.6s - 2027.6s] However, no agreement was reached even
[2023.6s - 2030.6s] then. In 1965, the two countries fought
[2027.6s - 2034.4s] the second war over Kashmir. one which
[2030.6s - 2036.9s] ended inconclusively with a ceasefire in
[2034.4s - 2039.2s] 1971. The Indian Army's involvement in
[2036.9s - 2041.2s] the Bangladesh liberation war culminated
[2039.2s - 2044.2s] in the similar agreement in
[2041.2s - 2048.1s] 1972 where both sides agreed to settle
[2044.2s - 2050.0s] any disputes by peaceful means. There
[2048.1s - 2052.6s] have been many more rounds of talks
[2050.0s - 2055.6s] after that all with limited success
[2052.6s - 2058.7s] because they were thwarted each time by
[2055.6s - 2061.8s] repeated acts of terror and crossber
[2058.7s - 2064.9s] violations by Pakistan. And not just
[2061.8s - 2067.5s] that, the fact that the peace talks did
[2064.9s - 2070.3s] not materialize is evident in the spate
[2067.5s - 2073.0s] of terror attacks that ensued such as
[2070.3s - 2075.4s] the December 2001 attack on the Indian
[2073.0s - 2078.9s] Parliament in New Delhi that killed 14
[2075.4s - 2081.0s] people. Then in November 2008, armed
[2078.9s - 2084.4s] gunmen opened fire on civilians at
[2081.0s - 2087.3s] several sites in Mumbai, killing over
[2084.4s - 2089.8s] 150. Even as trade relations began to
[2087.3s - 2092.7s] improve across the LOC and more
[2089.8s - 2095.8s] recently, talks were also initiated in
[2092.7s - 2099.2s] the aftermath of the 2016 Uri attacks
[2095.8s - 2102.0s] and Pulwama attacks in 2019. But
[2099.2s - 2104.4s] unfortunately, not to much avail. And
[2102.0s - 2106.8s] finally, the Pelgam terror attack on the
[2104.4s - 2109.4s] 22nd of April this year, which capped
[2106.8s - 2112.7s] all previous attacks for its mode of
[2109.4s - 2115.5s] warfare, a dastardly attack on civilians
[2112.7s - 2118.2s] and a clear message to India. At
[2115.5s - 2122.1s] Islamabad never did and perhaps never
[2118.2s - 2124.9s] will roll back its terror machine. Now
[2122.1s - 2126.4s] 22 days after India struck nine terror
[2124.9s - 2128.1s] camps across the line of control, the
[2126.4s - 2130.0s] Pakistani prime minister is admitting
[2128.1s - 2132.8s] that his country's armed forces were
[2130.0s - 2134.7s] caught off guard during operation
[2132.8s - 2136.3s] synindur. Now during his visit to
[2134.7s - 2138.4s] Azarbaijan, Shabbash Sharif has said
[2136.3s - 2140.6s] that India hit Pakistan with its Brahos
[2138.4s - 2143.3s] missiles before the Pakistani forces
[2140.6s - 2145.9s] could even launch an attack on India.
[2143.3s - 2149.5s] Listen in.
[2145.9s - 2153.0s] On ninth and 10th
[2149.5s - 2157.5s] night, we decided
[2153.0s - 2158.9s] to respond in a measured fashion to
[2157.5s - 2163.0s] Indian
[2158.9s - 2166.7s] aggression and we had decided that at
[2163.0s - 2168.4s] 4:30 in the morning after fajal
[2166.7s - 2170.7s] prayers
[2168.4s - 2176.6s] Pakistan armed
[2170.7s - 2181.1s] forces led very aly by our field marshal
[2176.6s - 2186.0s] Chief Army staff sitting here say
[2181.1s - 2188.9s] aim to teach a lesson to our
[2186.0s - 2194.9s] enemy. But
[2188.9s - 2198.3s] before that hour reached, India again
[2194.9s - 2202.1s] launched missile attacks
[2198.3s - 2205.4s] bramos and hit Pakistan's various
[2202.1s - 2209.1s] provinces including airport in Rahul
[2205.4s - 2209.1s] Pindi and other places.
[2209.8s - 2213.2s] Now responding to the deadly terror
[2211.1s - 2215.4s] attack in Pahelgam, India has struck
[2213.2s - 2216.9s] nine terror camps across the line of
[2215.4s - 2219.9s] control. Of the nine sites that were
[2216.9s - 2222.0s] targeted, five were in PK. Two sites
[2219.9s - 2224.4s] each were in Muzafarabad and Courtley
[2222.0s - 2227.0s] and one in Pimber and four in Pakistan's
[2224.4s - 2228.8s] Punjab province. While India stated that
[2227.0s - 2230.7s] the Pakistani army was not the target.
[2228.8s - 2232.1s] The Pakistani army has gone ahead with
[2230.7s - 2235.2s] indiscriminate attacks that were
[2232.1s - 2237.2s] repelled by India's air defense systems.
[2235.2s - 2239.7s] Now following this New Delhi launched a
[2237.2s - 2242.3s] counter action carrying out some
[2239.7s - 2245.8s] precision strikes deep inside Pakistan
[2242.3s - 2247.6s] striking about 11 military targets in
[2245.8s - 2249.5s] Azarban. The Pakistani prime minister
[2247.6s - 2251.5s] was referring to these strikes. India's
[2249.5s - 2255.8s] decisive action has prompted Pakistan to
[2251.5s - 2257.5s] seek peace with the DGMO. The Pakistani
[2255.8s - 2259.6s] initiating the contact with the Indian
[2257.5s - 2262.8s] side and agreeing to halt all firing and
[2259.6s - 2265.4s] military action on land, air and sea
[2262.8s - 2267.4s] which brought to an end the 4-day long
[2265.4s - 2269.8s] confrontation.
[2267.4s - 2271.7s] 22 days after India struck nine terror
[2269.8s - 2273.6s] camps across the line of control. The
[2271.7s - 2275.3s] Pakistani prime minister is finally
[2273.6s - 2277.5s] admitting that his country's armed
[2275.3s - 2280.3s] forces were caught off guard during
[2277.5s - 2282.4s] operation synindur. During his visit to
[2280.3s - 2284.6s] Azarbaijan, Shahbash Sharif said that
[2282.4s - 2287.4s] India hit Pakistan with its bramos
[2284.6s - 2290.7s] missiles before Pakistani forces could
[2287.4s - 2294.3s] launch an attack on India.
[2290.7s - 2297.8s] On 9inth and 10th
[2294.3s - 2302.3s] night, we decided
[2297.8s - 2303.7s] to respond in a measured fashion to
[2302.3s - 2307.8s] Indian
[2303.7s - 2311.5s] aggression and we had decided that at
[2307.8s - 2313.2s] 4:30 in the morning after fajar
[2311.5s - 2315.4s] prayers
[2313.2s - 2321.4s] Pakistan armed
[2315.4s - 2325.9s] forces led very aly by our field marshal
[2321.4s - 2331.8s] Chief Army Staff sitting here say Aam
[2325.9s - 2333.7s] Muner to teach a lesson to our enemy.
[2331.8s - 2339.7s] But
[2333.7s - 2343.2s] before that hour reached, India again
[2339.7s - 2347.0s] launched missile attacks
[2343.2s - 2350.2s] Bramos and hit Pakistan's various
[2347.0s - 2353.7s] provinces including airport in Rahul
[2350.2s - 2355.4s] Pindi and other places.
[2353.7s - 2357.6s] Responding to the deadly terror attack
[2355.4s - 2359.8s] in Pahelgam, India struck nine terror
[2357.6s - 2361.9s] camps across the line of control. Of the
[2359.8s - 2364.5s] nine sites that were targeted, five were
[2361.9s - 2367.3s] in Pakistan occupied Kashmir. Two sites
[2364.5s - 2369.5s] each were in Musafarabad and Kotley and
[2367.3s - 2371.2s] one in Bimbear and four in Pakistan's
[2369.5s - 2373.4s] Punjab
[2371.2s - 2375.5s] province. While India stated that
[2373.4s - 2377.3s] Pakistan army was not the target, the
[2375.5s - 2379.3s] Pakistan army went ahead with
[2377.3s - 2381.9s] indiscriminate attacks that were
[2379.3s - 2383.8s] repelled by India's air defense systems.
[2381.9s - 2385.6s] Now following this, New Delhi launched a
[2383.8s - 2388.1s] counter action carrying out precision
[2385.6s - 2390.4s] strikes deep inside Pakistan, striking
[2388.1s - 2393.1s] 11 military
[2390.4s - 2394.7s] targets. In Azabaijan, the Pakistani
[2393.1s - 2397.1s] prime minister was referring to these
[2394.7s - 2399.4s] strikes. India's decisive action
[2397.1s - 2401.9s] prompted Pakistan to seek peace with the
[2399.4s - 2404.3s] DGM of Pakistan initiating contact with
[2401.9s - 2406.3s] the Indian side and agreeing to halt all
[2404.3s - 2408.7s] firing and military action on land, air,
[2406.3s - 2409.9s] and sea, bringing an end to a three-day
[2408.7s - 2411.6s] long
[2409.9s - 2412.6s] confrontation. All right. We'll of
[2411.6s - 2414.1s] course continue to bring all
[2412.6s - 2416.2s] developments on that front. Let's shift
[2414.1s - 2417.9s] our focus for now. Pakistan's Prime
[2416.2s - 2419.9s] Minister Shba Sharif has admitted to
[2417.9s - 2422.9s] India's precision missile strike on the
[2419.9s - 2425.1s] Nuran air base in Rahul Pindi and other
[2422.9s - 2427.6s] sites. In a statement that has now gone
[2425.1s - 2430.5s] viral on social media, Sharif is heard
[2427.6s - 2432.6s] saying that Pakistan army chief Aimuner
[2430.5s - 2434.5s] personally called him at 2:30 a.m. on
[2432.6s - 2437.0s] the intervening night of the 9th of May
[2434.5s - 2440.3s] and the 10th of May to inform him about
[2437.0s - 2440.3s] the attack.
[2448.4s - 2452.4s] Nori General
[2464.8s - 2468.8s] says report.
[2471.4s - 2475.7s] The Pakistani prime minister made the
[2473.1s - 2478.0s] admission while addressing the Yom
[2475.7s - 2480.8s] Tashakur event in the Pakist at the
[2478.0s - 2483.2s] Pakistan monument in
[2480.8s - 2485.3s] Islamabad. India's counter strike it
[2483.2s - 2488.0s] targeted key Pakistani air bases
[2485.3s - 2491.9s] including Nur Khan, Rahheimar Khan,
[2488.0s - 2494.9s] Walari, Jakobabad, Scardu and Saroda.
[2491.9s - 2496.8s] These bases suffered extensive damage as
[2494.9s - 2499.7s] confirmed by satellite images released
[2496.8s - 2502.0s] by the Indian military. Satellite images
[2499.7s - 2504.5s] released by Maxar Technologies confirmed
[2502.0s - 2506.5s] attacks by the Indian armed forces. The
[2504.5s - 2509.0s] damage to Pakistani military facilities
[2506.5s - 2512.1s] have been devastating after crossber
[2509.0s - 2513.7s] strikes from India. Pakistan has made a
[2512.1s - 2515.2s] rare acknowledgement of its military
[2513.7s - 2517.3s] losses. Pakistan's Prime Minister
[2515.2s - 2519.8s] Shabbash Sharif has admitted India's
[2517.3s - 2522.2s] precision missile strikes on the Nurh
[2519.8s - 2524.5s] Khan air base in Rahul Pindi and other
[2522.2s - 2526.9s] sides. The Shabbash Sharif revealed that
[2524.5s - 2529.2s] Pakistan's army chief Aimuner had
[2526.9s - 2531.8s] personally called him at 2:30 a.m. on
[2529.2s - 2534.1s] the intervening night of the 9th of May
[2531.8s - 2537.1s] and 10th to inform him about the attack.
[2534.1s - 2537.1s] Listen.
[2546.9s - 2549.8s] General
[2558.0s - 2565.2s] say, ballistic missiles
[2562.2s - 2565.2s] launch
[2568.2s - 2571.7s] airport as part of operations. In
[2570.3s - 2574.2s] Synindur, the Indian Air Force, the
[2571.7s - 2575.8s] Indian Navy had worked in tandem to
[2574.2s - 2577.6s] strike a terror infrastructure and
[2575.8s - 2580.5s] strategic military installations across
[2577.6s - 2582.4s] Pakistan and Pakistan occupied Kashmir.
[2580.5s - 2583.8s] In the aftermath of operation Synindur,
[2582.4s - 2586.0s] India is of course continuing its fight
[2583.8s - 2588.0s] against Pakistan sponsored terror in its
[2586.0s - 2590.7s] latest crackdown on Pakistani spies and
[2588.0s - 2593.7s] sleeper cells. Six Indian nationals have
[2590.7s - 2595.3s] been arrested for spying for Pakistan.
[2593.7s - 2597.9s] Now, those arrested for sharing
[2595.3s - 2600.3s] sensitive information includes a Hanaab
[2597.9s - 2604.5s] based YouTuber and a travel blogger
[2600.3s - 2606.8s] called Joti Malhotra. The 33-year-old
[2604.5s - 2609.5s] YouTuber reportedly ran a travel account
[2606.8s - 2612.9s] named Travel with Joe. She's now been
[2609.5s - 2615.0s] arrested from Hisar in Hana for sharing
[2612.9s - 2618.1s] what is being described as sensitive
[2615.0s - 2620.0s] military information with Pakistan. She
[2618.1s - 2623.2s] allegedly had developed close ties with
[2620.0s - 2624.7s] Aasanu Rahman Rahim alias Dh Danish a
[2623.2s - 2627.0s] staff member at the Pakistani high
[2624.7s - 2629.4s] commission in New Delhi during her visit
[2627.0s - 2631.9s] to Pakistan. Now the accused is amongst
[2629.4s - 2633.9s] the six people including a 25-year-old
[2631.9s - 2636.9s] student and 24 yearear-old security
[2633.9s - 2639.3s] guard from Punjab who had been who have
[2636.9s - 2641.7s] been arrested on these charges. The
[2639.3s - 2644.0s] India has also busted a massive fake SIM
[2641.7s - 2645.2s] racket with Pakistani links under
[2644.0s - 2648.1s] operation
[2645.2s - 2651.7s] ghost sim Indian officials have traced
[2648.1s - 2654.2s] fake SIM card rackets across India and
[2651.7s - 2656.4s] they have so far made seven arrests from
[2654.2s - 2658.7s] three different states. Now India's
[2656.4s - 2660.5s] state investigation agency is currently
[2658.7s - 2663.2s] conducting raids at multiple locations
[2660.5s - 2664.6s] across central and north India. The
[2663.2s - 2666.2s] development follows the recent
[2664.6s - 2669.2s] documented raids that have been carried
[2666.2s - 2671.9s] out by the SIA on the 11th of May
[2669.2s - 2673.4s] targeting approximately 20 locations in
[2671.9s - 2676.4s] South Kashmir specifically in the
[2673.4s - 2679.4s] districts of Pulwama, Chopan, Kulgam and
[2676.4s - 2681.7s] also Anundant
[2679.4s - 2684.1s] and Pakistan Prime Minister Shah Sharif
[2681.7s - 2685.9s] has admitted that he was swimming while
[2684.1s - 2688.5s] India launched precision strikes on
[2685.9s - 2690.4s] Pakistan under operation Synindur. In a
[2688.5s - 2692.7s] statement at an event in Islamabad on
[2690.4s - 2694.6s] Friday, the Pakistan Prime Minister said
[2692.7s - 2696.6s] he received a call from General Sed
[2694.6s - 2699.0s] Aimunir around 2:30 a.m. on the
[2696.6s - 2701.3s] intervening night on May 9th and May
[2699.0s - 2703.7s] 10th, adding that he was informed that
[2701.3s - 2706.4s] India's ballistic missiles had hit Nuran
[2703.7s - 2708.5s] air base and other areas. Ashari further
[2706.4s - 2710.5s] went on to say that he was swimming when
[2708.5s - 2714.2s] he received the secure line call from
[2710.5s - 2714.2s] army chief Aimun.
[2734.4s - 2738.3s] foreign. As luck would have
[2743.0s - 2747.6s] it, the controversial statement of
[2745.5s - 2749.9s] Shahbha Sharif inadvertently admitting
[2747.6s - 2752.4s] to the strikes has drawn massive flag
[2749.9s - 2753.9s] from Pakistani citizens on social media.
[2752.4s - 2755.9s] India strikes in retaliation to the
[2753.9s - 2758.6s] pelgam terror attack targeted key
[2755.9s - 2761.3s] Pakistani air bases including Nurhan,
[2758.6s - 2763.8s] Rahheim Yar Khan, Malor, Jakobabad,
[2761.3s - 2765.4s] Sakadu and Sarugda. Well, as confirmed
[2763.8s - 2767.5s] by satellite images released by the
[2765.4s - 2770.1s] Indian military, the military bases in
[2767.5s - 2772.1s] Pakistan suffered extensive damage.
[2770.1s - 2773.8s] Satellite images released by Maxa
[2772.1s - 2775.8s] Technologies confirmed attacks by the
[2773.8s - 2778.0s] Indian armed forces. The damage to
[2775.8s - 2780.7s] Pakistani military facilities have been
[2778.0s - 2783.4s] devastating after crossber strikes from
[2780.7s - 2785.8s] India. In other news, weeks after India
[2783.4s - 2788.3s] conducted precision military strikes on
[2785.8s - 2791.5s] Pakistan's terror hubs in response to
[2788.3s - 2794.3s] the Pelgam terror attack, Pakistan cries
[2791.5s - 2797.1s] talks again. Pakistan's Prime Minister
[2794.3s - 2801.2s] Shabbaz Sharif has reportedly extended
[2797.1s - 2805.0s] India an olive branch. But going by past
[2801.2s - 2808.3s] experiences, if broken promises at talks
[2805.0s - 2812.1s] and dialogue had a face, there's few
[2808.3s - 2814.4s] more diabolical than Islamabad. Let's
[2812.1s - 2816.9s] break that down for you. During his
[2814.4s - 2819.5s] visit to Iran, Pakistan's Prime Minister
[2816.9s - 2822.4s] Shabbah Sharif said that he was ready to
[2819.5s - 2824.6s] engage in peace talks with India.
[2822.4s - 2827.4s] He even stressed on the importance of
[2824.6s - 2829.8s] dialogue to resolve outstanding disputes
[2827.4s - 2832.8s] and he has touched on a couple that have
[2829.8s - 2835.4s] troubled bilateral ties for decades.
[2832.8s - 2837.7s] Number one, Kashmir, a major flash point
[2835.4s - 2841.0s] between the neighbors. Number two,
[2837.7s - 2843.4s] terrorism. Water sharing and trade were
[2841.0s - 2846.0s] some of the others that the Pakistan
[2843.4s - 2847.7s] prime minister listed out. Shar's
[2846.0s - 2850.6s] remarks came weeks after India and
[2847.7s - 2853.1s] Pakistan agreed to military ceasefires.
[2850.6s - 2855.7s] Speaking to media in Thran, Sharif
[2853.1s - 2858.6s] signaled Islamabad's willingness to
[2855.7s - 2861.6s] pursue peace and diplomatic engagement
[2858.6s - 2865.4s] with India. A distinct shift from the
[2861.6s - 2868.2s] hostile tone taken earlier. However,
[2865.4s - 2870.1s] there were no missing the rider. Listen
[2868.2s - 2871.4s] to what the Pakistan prime minister
[2870.1s - 2873.6s] said.
[2871.4s - 2877.4s] We are ready to
[2873.6s - 2877.4s] talk for the sake of
[2878.1s - 2885.9s] peace on water issue with our
[2883.2s - 2889.6s] neighbor. We are ready to talk to
[2885.9s - 2891.6s] promote trade and
[2889.6s - 2895.3s] also
[2891.6s - 2899.3s] counterterrorism if they are
[2895.3s - 2902.6s] serious. But if they choose to to remain
[2899.3s - 2904.8s] aggressor then we shall defend our
[2902.6s - 2908.8s] territory and our
[2904.8s - 2911.0s] country like we have done.
[2908.8s - 2913.7s] Clearly Sharif seems interested in
[2911.0s - 2916.8s] settling scores with New Delhi but with
[2913.7s - 2920.1s] a condition or rather a subdued threat
[2916.8s - 2923.1s] of sorts. Accept the offer for peace or
[2920.1s - 2925.7s] be ready for war. India has responded
[2923.1s - 2928.1s] firmly and in a discreet manner. Prime
[2925.7s - 2930.2s] Minister Narendra Modi has made it
[2928.1s - 2933.4s] extremely clear, crystal clear that
[2930.2s - 2935.1s] terror and talks cannot go hand in hand.
[2933.4s - 2937.3s] Prime Minister Modi said any dialogue
[2935.1s - 2939.9s] with Pakistan will be limited to the
[2937.3s - 2943.4s] return of Pakistan occupied Kashmir and
[2939.9s - 2945.5s] the issue of terrorism only. Addressing
[2943.4s - 2948.0s] an event in the Indian state of Gujarat,
[2945.5s - 2950.3s] Prime Minister Modi said Pakistan had
[2948.0s - 2953.0s] shown clear backing for terrorist
[2950.3s - 2956.6s] elements during operation Sindur with
[2953.0s - 2956.6s] proof loud and clear.
[2977.4s - 2981.1s] State owner
[2982.4s - 2986.0s] Pakistan coffin
[2990.2s - 2994.2s] Pakistan salute.
[3017.8s - 3021.0s] similar proof was put forth from the
[3019.4s - 3022.9s] Indian side as well. One that
[3021.0s - 3026.2s] established the success of its
[3022.9s - 3028.5s] retaliatory strike operation Synindhur.
[3026.2s - 3031.1s] In a newly released video by India's
[3028.5s - 3033.7s] Border Security Force of BSF, Prime
[3031.1s - 3036.6s] Minister Modi termed it decisive action
[3033.7s - 3041.6s] and strong reflection of India's zero
[3036.6s - 3041.6s] tolerance for any form of terror.
[3056.6s - 3059.8s] [Music]
[3066.3s - 3071.3s] India and Pakistan have shared a
[3068.4s - 3073.2s] troubled relationship since 1947. That's
[3071.3s - 3075.4s] the year of partition. Since then, both
[3073.2s - 3078.6s] India and Pakistan have fought multiple
[3075.4s - 3082.1s] wars. But when it comes to Islamabad,
[3078.6s - 3084.8s] old habits die hard, thus rendering past
[3082.1s - 3087.2s] talks pretty much meaningless and
[3084.8s - 3090.9s] leaving the prospect of peace rather
[3087.2s - 3093.2s] elusive. In October 1947, the first war
[3090.9s - 3096.9s] over Kashmir broke out and continued
[3093.2s - 3100.2s] until 1948 when Kashmir was divided.
[3096.9s - 3103.5s] Eventually failed talks led to a second
[3100.2s - 3105.7s] war in 1960s which is also when India
[3103.5s - 3109.3s] and Pakistan signed the Indis waters
[3105.7s - 3111.4s] treaty in 1963. Talks were held once
[3109.3s - 3114.7s] again over the disputed territory of
[3111.4s - 3117.6s] Kashmir mediated by the US and the UK.
[3114.7s - 3121.7s] However, no agreement was reached even
[3117.6s - 3124.6s] then. In 1965, the two countries fought
[3121.7s - 3128.4s] the second war over Kashmir. one which
[3124.6s - 3130.9s] ended inconclusively with a ceasefire in
[3128.4s - 3133.3s] 1971. The Indian Army's involvement in
[3130.9s - 3136.6s] the Bangladesh liberation war culminated
[3133.3s - 3139.7s] in the similar agreement in 1972 where
[3136.6s - 3143.0s] both sides agreed to settle any disputes
[3139.7s - 3145.4s] by peaceful means. There have been many
[3143.0s - 3147.8s] more rounds of talks after that all with
[3145.4s - 3150.8s] limited success because they were
[3147.8s - 3154.2s] thwarted each time by repeated acts of
[3150.8s - 3157.0s] terror and crossber violations by
[3154.2s - 3160.0s] Pakistan. And not just that, the fact
[3157.0s - 3162.1s] that the peace talks did not materialize
[3160.0s - 3165.0s] is evident in the spate of terror
[3162.1s - 3167.6s] attacks that ensued such as the December
[3165.0s - 3171.0s] 2001 attack on the Indian Parliament in
[3167.6s - 3174.1s] New Delhi that killed 14 people. Then in
[3171.0s - 3177.2s] November 2008, armed gunmen opened fire
[3174.1s - 3180.2s] on civilians at several sites in Mumbai,
[3177.2s - 3182.2s] killing over 150. Even as trade
[3180.2s - 3185.5s] relations began to improve across the
[3182.2s - 3188.9s] LOC and more recently, talks were also
[3185.5s - 3192.9s] initiated in the aftermath of the 2016
[3188.9s - 3195.8s] Uri attacks and Pulwama attacks in 2019.
[3192.9s - 3198.3s] But unfortunately, not to much avail.
[3195.8s - 3200.4s] And finally, the Pelgam terror attack on
[3198.3s - 3203.2s] the 22nd of April this year, which
[3200.4s - 3206.2s] capped all previous attacks for its mode
[3203.2s - 3209.0s] of warfare. A dastardly attack on
[3206.2s - 3211.9s] civilians and a clear message to India
[3209.0s - 3215.8s] that Islamabad never did and perhaps
[3211.9s - 3218.6s] never will roll back its terror machine.
[3215.8s - 3220.3s] Now, 22 days after India struck nine
[3218.6s - 3221.8s] terror camps across the line of control,
[3220.3s - 3223.4s] the Pakistani prime minister is
[3221.8s - 3225.8s] admitting that his country's armed
[3223.4s - 3228.4s] forces were caught off guard.
[3225.8s - 3230.2s] during operation Synindu. Now during his
[3228.4s - 3231.9s] visit to Azarbaan, Shabbah Sharif has
[3230.2s - 3234.3s] said that India hit Pakistan with its
[3231.9s - 3236.9s] Brahos missiles before the Pakistani
[3234.3s - 3239.9s] forces could even launch an attack on
[3236.9s - 3243.6s] India. Listen in.
[3239.9s - 3247.1s] On 9th and 10th
[3243.6s - 3251.6s] night, we decided
[3247.1s - 3254.1s] to respond in a measured fashion to
[3251.6s - 3258.1s] Indian aggression.
[3254.1s - 3260.8s] And we had decided that at 4:30 in the
[3258.1s - 3262.4s] morning after fajal
[3260.8s - 3264.7s] prayers
[3262.4s - 3269.6s] Pakistan armed
[3264.7s - 3273.3s] forces led very aly by our field
[3269.6s - 3275.1s] marshal chief army staff sitting here
[3273.3s - 3280.0s] say
[3275.1s - 3283.0s] aim to teach a lesson to our
[3280.0s - 3289.0s] enemy. But
[3283.0s - 3292.4s] before that hour reached, India again
[3289.0s - 3296.2s] launched missile attacks
[3292.4s - 3299.4s] Bramos and hit Pakistan's various
[3296.2s - 3302.2s] provinces including airport in Rahul
[3299.4s - 3302.2s] Pindi and other
[3302.6s - 3307.3s] places. Responding to the deadly terror
[3305.1s - 3309.4s] attack in Pahelgam, India has struck
[3307.3s - 3311.0s] nine terror camps across the line of
[3309.4s - 3314.0s] control. Of the nine sites that were
[3311.0s - 3316.2s] targeted, five were in PK. Two sides
[3314.0s - 3318.4s] each were in Muzafarabad and Kley and
[3316.2s - 3321.0s] one in Pimber and four in Pakistan's
[3318.4s - 3322.8s] Punjab province. While India stated that
[3321.0s - 3324.7s] the Pakistani army was not the target.
[3322.8s - 3326.2s] The Pakistani army has gone ahead with
[3324.7s - 3329.2s] indiscriminate attacks that were
[3326.2s - 3331.2s] repelled by India's air defense systems.
[3329.2s - 3333.7s] Now following this, New Delhi launched a
[3331.2s - 3336.3s] counter action carrying out some
[3333.7s - 3339.8s] precision strikes deep inside Pakistan
[3336.3s - 3341.6s] striking about 11 military targets. In
[3339.8s - 3343.5s] Azharbajan, the Pakistani prime minister
[3341.6s - 3345.5s] was referring to these strikes. India's
[3343.5s - 3349.8s] decisive action has prompted Pakistan to
[3345.5s - 3351.5s] seek peace with the DGMO. The Pakistani
[3349.8s - 3353.6s] initiating the contact with the Indian
[3351.5s - 3356.8s] side and agreeing to halt all fing
[3353.6s - 3359.4s] military action on land, air and sea
[3356.8s - 3361.4s] which brought to an end the 4-day long
[3359.4s - 3363.8s] confrontation.
[3361.4s - 3365.7s] 22 days after India struck nine terror
[3363.8s - 3367.7s] camps across the line of control. The
[3365.7s - 3369.4s] Pakistani prime minister is finally
[3367.7s - 3371.6s] admitting that his country's armed
[3369.4s - 3374.3s] forces were caught off guard during
[3371.6s - 3376.4s] operation Synindur. During his visit to
[3374.3s - 3378.6s] Azarbaijan, Shabbash Sharif said that
[3376.4s - 3381.4s] India hit Pakistan with its bramos
[3378.6s - 3384.7s] missiles before Pakistani forces could
[3381.4s - 3388.3s] launch an attack on India.
[3384.7s - 3391.9s] On ninth and 10th
[3388.3s - 3396.3s] night, we decided
[3391.9s - 3397.7s] to respond in a measured fashion to
[3396.3s - 3401.8s] Indian
[3397.7s - 3405.6s] aggression and we had decided that at
[3401.8s - 3407.2s] 4:30 in the morning after fajal
[3405.6s - 3409.5s] prayers
[3407.2s - 3413.4s] Pakistan armed
[3409.5s - 3415.4s] forces led very aly by our field
[3413.4s - 3419.9s] marshall
[3415.4s - 3424.8s] Chief Army staff sitting here say
[3419.9s - 3427.8s] aim to teach a lesson to our
[3424.8s - 3433.8s] enemy. But
[3427.8s - 3437.2s] before that hour reached, India again
[3433.8s - 3441.0s] launched missile attacks
[3437.2s - 3444.2s] Bramos and hit Pakistan's various
[3441.0s - 3447.8s] provinces including airport in Rahul
[3444.2s - 3449.4s] Pindi and other places.
[3447.8s - 3451.7s] Responding to the deadly terror attack
[3449.4s - 3453.8s] in Pahelgam, India struck nine terror
[3451.7s - 3455.9s] camps across the line of control. Of the
[3453.8s - 3458.5s] nine sites that were targeted, five were
[3455.9s - 3461.3s] in Pakistan occupied Kashmir, two sides
[3458.5s - 3463.5s] each were in Musafarabad and Kotley and
[3461.3s - 3465.2s] one in Bimber and four in Pakistan's
[3463.5s - 3467.5s] Punjab
[3465.2s - 3469.5s] province. While India stated that
[3467.5s - 3471.4s] Pakistan army was not the target, the
[3469.5s - 3473.3s] Pakistan army went ahead with
[3471.4s - 3475.9s] indiscriminate attacks that were
[3473.3s - 3477.8s] repelled by India's air defense systems.
[3475.9s - 3479.6s] Now following this, New Delhi launched a
[3477.8s - 3482.2s] counter action carrying out precision
[3479.6s - 3484.5s] strikes deep inside Pakistan, striking
[3482.2s - 3487.4s] 11 military
[3484.5s - 3489.7s] targets. In Azaban, the Pakistani prime
[3487.4s - 3491.6s] minister was referring to these strikes.
[3489.7s - 3494.2s] India's decisive action prompted
[3491.6s - 3496.1s] Pakistan to seek peace with the DGM of
[3494.2s - 3498.4s] Pakistan initiating contact with the
[3496.1s - 3500.4s] Indian side and agreeing to halt all
[3498.4s - 3502.8s] firing and military action on land, air,
[3500.4s - 3505.0s] and sea, bringing an end to a three-day
[3502.8s - 3506.3s] long confrontation.
[3505.0s - 3507.8s] All right, we'll of course continue to
[3506.3s - 3509.4s] bring all developments on that front.
[3507.8s - 3511.4s] Let's shift our focus for now.
[3509.4s - 3513.0s] Pakistan's Prime Minister Shba Sharif
[3511.4s - 3515.3s] has admitted to India's precision
[3513.0s - 3518.1s] missile strike on the Nuran air base in
[3515.3s - 3519.8s] Rahul Pindi and other sites. In a
[3518.1s - 3521.9s] statement that has now gone viral on
[3519.8s - 3524.6s] social media. Sharif is heard saying
[3521.9s - 3526.7s] that Pakistan army chief Aimuner
[3524.6s - 3528.6s] personally called him at 2:30 a.m. on
[3526.7s - 3531.2s] the intervening night of the 9th of May
[3528.6s - 3534.4s] and the 10th of May to inform him about
[3531.2s - 3534.4s] the attack.
[3543.5s - 3546.4s] General
[3551.7s - 3559.9s] say
[3554.7s - 3562.9s] Hindustan ballistic missile launch
[3559.9s - 3562.9s] report.
[3565.4s - 3569.8s] The Pakistani Prime Minister made the
[3567.1s - 3572.0s] admission while addressing the Yom
[3569.8s - 3574.8s] Tashakur event in the Pakist at the
[3572.0s - 3577.2s] Pakistan monument in
[3574.8s - 3579.3s] Islamabad. India's counter strike it
[3577.2s - 3582.0s] targeted key Pakistani air bases
[3579.3s - 3585.9s] including Nur Khan, Rahimar Khan,
[3582.0s - 3588.9s] Balari, Jakobabad, Scardu and Saroda.
[3585.9s - 3590.8s] These bases suffered extensive damage as
[3588.9s - 3593.7s] confirmed by satellite images released
[3590.8s - 3596.0s] by the Indian military. Satellite images
[3593.7s - 3598.5s] released by Maxar Technologies confirmed
[3596.0s - 3600.5s] attacks by the Indian armed forces. The
[3598.5s - 3603.1s] damage to Pakistani military facilities
[3600.5s - 3606.1s] have been devastating after crossber
[3603.1s - 3607.8s] strikes from India. Pakistan has made a
[3606.1s - 3609.4s] rare acknowledgement of its military
[3607.8s - 3611.4s] losses. Pakistan's Prime Minister
[3609.4s - 3613.9s] Shabbah Sharif has admitted India's
[3611.4s - 3616.3s] precision missile strikes on the Nurh
[3613.9s - 3618.6s] Khan air base in Rahul Pindi and other
[3616.3s - 3621.0s] sides. The Shabbash Sharif revealed that
[3618.6s - 3623.4s] Pakistan's army chief Aimuner had
[3621.0s - 3625.8s] personally called him at 2:30 a.m. on
[3623.4s - 3628.2s] the intervening night of the 9th of May
[3625.8s - 3631.2s] and 10th to inform him about the attack.
[3628.2s - 3631.2s] Listen.
[3641.0s - 3643.9s] General
[3652.1s - 3659.3s] say, ballistic missiles
[3656.3s - 3659.3s] launch
[3662.3s - 3666.8s] airport as part of operations Synindur
[3664.8s - 3669.1s] the Indian Air Force, the Indian Navy
[3666.8s - 3670.7s] had worked in tandem to strike a terror
[3669.1s - 3672.4s] infrastructure and strategic military
[3670.7s - 3674.9s] installations across Pakistan and
[3672.4s - 3676.6s] Pakistan occupied Kashmir. In the
[3674.9s - 3677.8s] aftermath of operation Synindhur, India
[3676.6s - 3680.1s] is of course continuing its fight
[3677.8s - 3682.1s] against Pakistan sponsored terror in its
[3680.1s - 3684.7s] latest crackdown on Pakistani spies and
[3682.1s - 3687.7s] sleeper cells. Six Indian nationals have
[3684.7s - 3689.3s] been arrested for spying for Pakistan.
[3687.7s - 3691.9s] Now, those arrested for sharing
[3689.3s - 3694.3s] sensitive information includes a Hanaab
[3691.9s - 3698.6s] based YouTuber and a travel blogger
[3694.3s - 3700.9s] called Joti Malhotra. The 33-year-old
[3698.6s - 3703.6s] YouTuber reportedly ran a travel account
[3700.9s - 3706.9s] named Travel with Joe. She's now been
[3703.6s - 3709.1s] arrested from Hisar in Hana for sharing
[3706.9s - 3712.2s] what is being described as sensitive
[3709.1s - 3714.1s] military information with Pakistan. She
[3712.2s - 3717.5s] allegedly had developed close ties with
[3714.1s - 3719.4s] Easan Rahman Rahim alias Dhanish a staff
[3717.5s - 3722.2s] member the Pakistani high commission in
[3719.4s - 3724.0s] New Delhi during her visit to Pakistan.
[3722.2s - 3726.3s] Now the accused is amongst the six
[3724.0s - 3728.7s] people including a 25-year-old student
[3726.3s - 3731.0s] and 24 yearear-old security guard from
[3728.7s - 3733.8s] Punjab who had been who have been
[3731.0s - 3736.2s] arrested on these charges. Now India has
[3733.8s - 3739.2s] also busted a massive fake SIM racket
[3736.2s - 3742.1s] with Pakistani links under operation
[3739.2s - 3745.7s] ghost sim Indian officials have traced
[3742.1s - 3748.2s] fake SIM card rackets across India and
[3745.7s - 3750.4s] they have so far made seven arrests from
[3748.2s - 3752.7s] three different states. Now India's
[3750.4s - 3754.5s] state investigation agency is currently
[3752.7s - 3757.3s] conducting raids at multiple locations
[3754.5s - 3758.6s] across central and north India. The
[3757.3s - 3760.2s] development follows the recent
[3758.6s - 3763.3s] documented raids that have been carried
[3760.2s - 3765.9s] out by the SIA on the 11th of May
[3763.3s - 3767.4s] targeting approximately 20 locations in
[3765.9s - 3770.2s] South Kashmir specifically in the
[3767.4s - 3773.5s] districts of Pulwama, Chopyan, Kulgam
[3770.2s - 3775.7s] and also Anundant Nag
[3773.5s - 3778.2s] and Pakistan Prime Minister Shah Sharif
[3775.7s - 3780.0s] has admitted that he was swimming while
[3778.2s - 3782.5s] India launched precision strikes on
[3780.0s - 3784.5s] Pakistan under operation Sindur. In a
[3782.5s - 3786.7s] statement at an event in Islamabad on
[3784.5s - 3789.4s] Friday, the Pakistan Prime Minister said
[3786.7s - 3791.1s] he received a call from General Sedimir
[3789.4s - 3794.0s] around 2:30 a.m. on the intervening
[3791.1s - 3795.8s] night on May 9th and May 10th, adding
[3794.0s - 3797.9s] that he was informed that India's
[3795.8s - 3800.4s] ballistic missiles had hit Nuran air
[3797.9s - 3802.5s] base and other areas. Now Shari further
[3800.4s - 3804.5s] went on to say that he was swimming when
[3802.5s - 3808.2s] he received the secure line call from
[3804.5s - 3808.2s] Army Chief Aimuner.
[3829.4s - 3832.4s] As luck would have
[3837.0s - 3841.9s] it, the controversial statement of
[3839.5s - 3844.2s] Shahashar inadvertently admitting to the
[3841.9s - 3846.4s] strikes has drawn massive flag from
[3844.2s - 3847.9s] Pakistani citizens on social media.
[3846.4s - 3850.0s] India strikes in retaliation to the
[3847.9s - 3852.6s] pelgam terror attack targeted key
[3850.0s - 3855.4s] Pakistani air bases including Nurh Khan,
[3852.6s - 3858.1s] Rahim Yar Khan, Malore, Jakobabad,
[3855.4s - 3859.8s] Sakadu and Saruga. Well, as confirmed by
[3858.1s - 3862.2s] satellite images released by the Indian
[3859.8s - 3864.6s] military, the military bases in Pakistan
[3862.2s - 3866.7s] suffered extensive damage. Satellite
[3864.6s - 3868.5s] images released by Maxa Technologies
[3866.7s - 3870.9s] confirmed attacks by the Indian armed
[3868.5s - 3873.3s] forces. The damage to Pakistani military
[3870.9s - 3876.2s] facilities have been devastating after
[3873.3s - 3878.1s] crossber strikes from India. In other
[3876.2s - 3880.6s] news, weeks after India conducted
[3878.1s - 3883.1s] precision military strikes on Pakistan's
[3880.6s - 3886.0s] terror hubs in response to the pelgam
[3883.1s - 3888.8s] terror attack, Pakistan cries talks
[3886.0s - 3892.2s] again. Pakistan's prime minister Shabbaz
[3888.8s - 3895.2s] Sharif has reportedly extended India and
[3892.2s - 3899.0s] olive branch. But going by past
[3895.2s - 3902.4s] experiences, if broken promises at talks
[3899.0s - 3906.2s] and dialogue had a face, there's few
[3902.4s - 3908.5s] more diabolical than Islamabad. Let's
[3906.2s - 3911.0s] break that down for you. During his
[3908.5s - 3913.6s] visit to Iran, Pakistan's Prime Minister
[3911.0s - 3916.6s] Shabbah Sharif said that he was ready to
[3913.6s - 3918.6s] engage in peace talks with India. He
[3916.6s - 3920.6s] even stressed on the importance of
[3918.6s - 3923.3s] dialogue to resolve outstanding
[3920.6s - 3925.8s] disputes. and he has touched on a couple
[3923.3s - 3928.8s] that have troubled bilateral ties for
[3925.8s - 3930.9s] decades. Number one, Kashmir, a major
[3928.8s - 3934.1s] flash point between the neighbors.
[3930.9s - 3936.9s] Number two, terrorism, water sharing and
[3934.1s - 3939.5s] trade were some of the others that the
[3936.9s - 3941.6s] Pakistan prime minister listed out.
[3939.5s - 3943.6s] Sharif's remarks came weeks after India
[3941.6s - 3946.6s] and Pakistan agreed to military
[3943.6s - 3949.4s] ceasefires. Speaking to media in Thran,
[3946.6s - 3951.9s] Sharif signaled Islamabad's willingness
[3949.4s - 3955.1s] to pursue peace and diplomatic
[3951.9s - 3958.5s] engagement with India. A distinct shift
[3955.1s - 3961.1s] from the hostile tone taken earlier.
[3958.5s - 3963.8s] However, there were no missing the
[3961.1s - 3965.4s] rider. Listen to what the Pakistan prime
[3963.8s - 3967.6s] minister said.
[3965.4s - 3971.4s] We are ready to
[3967.6s - 3971.4s] talk for the sake of
[3972.2s - 3979.9s] peace on water issue with our
[3977.2s - 3980.9s] neighbor. We are ready to talk to
[3979.9s - 3983.7s] promote
[3980.9s - 3985.6s] trade and
[3983.7s - 3989.3s] also
[3985.6s - 3993.4s] counterterrorism if they are
[3989.3s - 3996.7s] serious. But if they choose to to remain
[3993.4s - 3998.9s] aggressor then we shall defend our
[3996.7s - 4002.9s] territory and our
[3998.9s - 4005.0s] country like we have done.
[4002.9s - 4007.8s] Clearly Sharif seems interested in
[4005.0s - 4010.9s] settling scores with New Delhi but with
[4007.8s - 4014.1s] a condition or rather a subdued threat
[4010.9s - 4017.1s] of sorts. Accept the offer for peace or
[4014.1s - 4019.7s] be ready for war. India has responded
[4017.1s - 4022.2s] firmly and in a discreet manner. Prime
[4019.7s - 4024.2s] Minister Narendra Modi has made it
[4022.2s - 4027.4s] extremely clear, crystal clear that
[4024.2s - 4029.2s] terror and talks cannot go hand in hand.
[4027.4s - 4031.4s] Prime Minister Modi said any dialogue
[4029.2s - 4033.9s] with Pakistan will be limited to the
[4031.4s - 4037.4s] return of Pakistan occupied Kashmir and
[4033.9s - 4039.6s] the issue of terrorism only. Addressing
[4037.4s - 4042.1s] an event in the Indian state of Gujarat,
[4039.6s - 4044.3s] Prime Minister Modi said Pakistan had
[4042.1s - 4047.1s] shown clear backing for terrorist
[4044.3s - 4050.7s] elements during operation Sindur with
[4047.1s - 4050.7s] proof loud and clear.
[4071.5s - 4075.1s] state owner.
[4078.4s - 4081.4s] Coffee
[4084.2s - 4088.2s] Pakistan salute.
[4110.8s - 4115.0s] So, similar proof was put forth from the
[4113.5s - 4117.0s] Indian side as well. One that
[4115.0s - 4120.2s] established the success of its
[4117.0s - 4122.6s] retaliatory strike, Operation Synindur.
[4120.2s - 4125.1s] In a newly released video by India's
[4122.6s - 4127.8s] Border Security Force or BSF, Prime
[4125.1s - 4130.6s] Minister Modi termed it decisive action
[4127.8s - 4135.6s] and strong reflection of India's zero
[4130.6s - 4135.6s] tolerance for any form of terror.
[4150.6s - 4153.8s] [Music]
[4160.3s - 4165.3s] India and Pakistan have shared a
[4162.5s - 4167.3s] troubled relationship since 1947. That's
[4165.3s - 4169.4s] the year of partition. Since then, both
[4167.3s - 4172.6s] India and Pakistan have fought multiple
[4169.4s - 4176.1s] wars. But when it comes to Islamabad,
[4172.6s - 4178.8s] old habits die hard, thus rendering past
[4176.1s - 4181.2s] talks pretty much meaningless and
[4178.8s - 4184.9s] leaving the prospect of peace rather
[4181.2s - 4187.2s] elusive. In October 1947, the first war
[4184.9s - 4190.9s] over Kashmir broke out and continued
[4187.2s - 4194.2s] until 1948 when Kashmir was divided.
[4190.9s - 4197.6s] Eventually failed talks led to a second
[4194.2s - 4199.7s] war in 1960s which is also when India
[4197.6s - 4203.3s] and Pakistan signed the Indis waters
[4199.7s - 4205.4s] treaty in 1963. Talks were held once
[4203.3s - 4208.7s] again over the disputed territory of
[4205.4s - 4211.6s] Kashmir mediated by the US and the UK.
[4208.7s - 4215.7s] However, no agreement was reached even
[4211.6s - 4218.6s] then. In 1965, the two countries fought
[4215.7s - 4222.4s] the second war over Kashmir. one which
[4218.6s - 4224.9s] ended inconclusively with a ceasefire in
[4222.4s - 4227.3s] 1971. The Indian Army's involvement in
[4224.9s - 4229.3s] the Bangladesh liberation war culminated
[4227.3s - 4232.3s] in the similar agreement in
[4229.3s - 4236.2s] 1972 where both sides agreed to settle
[4232.3s - 4238.1s] any disputes by peaceful means. There
[4236.2s - 4240.7s] have been many more rounds of talks
[4238.1s - 4243.7s] after that all with limited success
[4240.7s - 4246.8s] because they were thwarted each time by
[4243.7s - 4249.8s] repeated acts of terror and crossber
[4246.8s - 4253.0s] violations by Pakistan. And not just
[4249.8s - 4255.6s] that, the fact that the peace talks did
[4253.0s - 4258.4s] not materialize is evident in the spate
[4255.6s - 4261.0s] of terror attacks that ensued such as
[4258.4s - 4263.5s] the December 2001 attack on the Indian
[4261.0s - 4267.0s] Parliament in New Delhi that killed 14
[4263.5s - 4269.1s] people. Then in November 2008, armed
[4267.0s - 4272.5s] gunmen opened fire on civilians at
[4269.1s - 4275.4s] several sites in Mumbai, killing over
[4272.5s - 4277.8s] 150. Even as trade relations began to
[4275.4s - 4280.8s] improve across the LOC and more
[4277.8s - 4283.9s] recently, talks were also initiated in
[4280.8s - 4287.2s] the aftermath of the 2016 Uri attacks
[4283.9s - 4290.1s] and Pulama attacks in 2019. But
[4287.2s - 4292.5s] unfortunately, not to much avail. And
[4290.1s - 4294.9s] finally, the Pelgam terror attack on the
[4292.5s - 4297.6s] 22nd of April this year, which capped
[4294.9s - 4300.8s] all previous attacks for its mode of
[4297.6s - 4303.6s] warfare. A dastardly attack on civilians
[4300.8s - 4306.3s] and a clear message to India that
[4303.6s - 4310.2s] Islamabad never did and perhaps never
[4306.3s - 4313.0s] will roll back its terror machine. Now
[4310.2s - 4314.5s] 22 days after India struck nine terror
[4313.0s - 4316.2s] camps across the line of control, the
[4314.5s - 4318.0s] Pakistani prime minister is admitting
[4316.2s - 4320.9s] that his country's armed forces were
[4318.0s - 4322.7s] caught off guard during operation
[4320.9s - 4324.6s] synindur. Now during his visit to
[4322.7s - 4326.5s] Azarbaan, Shabbash Sharif has said that
[4324.6s - 4328.7s] India hit Pakistan with its Brahos
[4326.5s - 4331.4s] missiles before the Pakistani forces
[4328.7s - 4332.8s] could even launch an attack on India.
[4331.4s - 4337.6s] Isn't
[4332.8s - 4341.1s] it? On 9inth and 10th
[4337.6s - 4345.6s] night, we decided
[4341.1s - 4347.0s] to respond in a measured fashion to
[4345.6s - 4351.1s] Indian
[4347.0s - 4354.8s] aggression and we had decided that at
[4351.1s - 4356.4s] 4:30 in the morning after fajar
[4354.8s - 4358.7s] prayers
[4356.4s - 4364.6s] Pakistan armed
[4358.7s - 4369.2s] forces led very aly by our field marshal
[4364.6s - 4374.0s] Chief Army staff sitting here say
[4369.2s - 4377.0s] aim to teach a lesson to our
[4374.0s - 4383.0s] enemy. But
[4377.0s - 4386.4s] before that hour reached, India again
[4383.0s - 4390.2s] launched missile attacks
[4386.4s - 4393.5s] bramos and hit Pakistan's various
[4390.2s - 4397.2s] provinces including airport in Rahul
[4393.5s - 4397.2s] Pindi and other places.
[4397.8s - 4401.9s] Now responding to the deadly terror
[4399.2s - 4403.8s] attack in Pelgam, India has struck nine
[4401.9s - 4405.5s] terror camps across the line of control.
[4403.8s - 4408.6s] Of the nine sites that were targeted,
[4405.5s - 4411.3s] five were in PK. Two sites each were in
[4408.6s - 4414.1s] Muzafarabad and Kley and one in Pimber
[4411.3s - 4415.7s] and four in Pakistan's Punjab province.
[4414.1s - 4417.5s] While India stated that the Pakistani
[4415.7s - 4419.5s] army was not the target. The Pakistani
[4417.5s - 4421.6s] army has gone ahead with indiscriminate
[4419.5s - 4424.1s] attacks that were repelled by India's
[4421.6s - 4427.0s] air defense systems. Now following this
[4424.1s - 4428.8s] New Delhi launched a counter action
[4427.0s - 4431.9s] carrying out some precision strikes deep
[4428.8s - 4434.6s] inside Pakistan striking about 11
[4431.9s - 4436.2s] military targets in Azarban. The
[4434.6s - 4438.0s] Pakistani prime minister was referring
[4436.2s - 4439.8s] to these strikes. India's decisive
[4438.0s - 4443.8s] action has prompted Pakistan to seek
[4439.8s - 4445.6s] peace with the DGMO. The Pakistani
[4443.8s - 4447.7s] initiating the contact with the Indian
[4445.6s - 4450.9s] side and agreeing to halt all firing and
[4447.7s - 4453.4s] military action on land, air and sea
[4450.9s - 4455.4s] which brought to an end the 4-day long
[4453.4s - 4457.8s] confrontation.
[4455.4s - 4459.8s] 22 days after India struck nine terror
[4457.8s - 4461.7s] camps across the line of control. The
[4459.8s - 4463.4s] Pakistani prime minister is finally
[4461.7s - 4465.6s] admitting that his country's armed
[4463.4s - 4468.4s] forces were caught off guard during
[4465.6s - 4470.5s] operation synindur. During his visit to
[4468.4s - 4472.6s] Azarupaijan, Shahbash Sharif said that
[4470.5s - 4475.4s] India hit Pakistan with its bramos
[4472.6s - 4478.8s] missiles before Pakistani forces could
[4475.4s - 4482.4s] launch an attack on India.
[4478.8s - 4485.9s] On 9inth and 10th
[4482.4s - 4490.4s] night, we decided
[4485.9s - 4491.8s] to respond in a measured fashion to
[4490.4s - 4495.9s] Indian
[4491.8s - 4499.6s] aggression and we had decided that at
[4495.9s - 4501.2s] 4:30 in the morning after fajger
[4499.6s - 4503.5s] prayers
[4501.2s - 4509.4s] Pakistan armed
[4503.5s - 4514.0s] forces led very aly by our field marshal
[4509.4s - 4518.8s] Chief Army Staff sitting here say Aam
[4514.0s - 4521.8s] Muner to teach a lesson to our
[4518.8s - 4527.8s] enemy. But
[4521.8s - 4531.2s] before that hour reached, India again
[4527.8s - 4535.0s] launched missile attacks
[4531.2s - 4538.3s] Bramos and hit Pakistan's various
[4535.0s - 4541.8s] provinces including airport in Rahul
[4538.3s - 4543.5s] Pindi and other places.
[4541.8s - 4545.7s] Responding to the deadly terror attack
[4543.5s - 4547.8s] in Pahelgam, India struck nine terror
[4545.7s - 4549.9s] camps across the line of control. Of the
[4547.8s - 4552.5s] nine sites that were targeted, five were
[4549.9s - 4555.3s] in Pakistan occupied Kashmir, two sides
[4552.5s - 4557.5s] each were in Muzafarabad and Kotley and
[4555.3s - 4559.2s] one in Bimbear and four in Pakistan's
[4557.5s - 4561.4s] Punjab
[4559.2s - 4563.5s] province. While India stated that
[4561.4s - 4565.3s] Pakistan army was not the target, the
[4563.5s - 4567.3s] Pakistan army went ahead with
[4565.3s - 4570.0s] indiscriminate attacks that were
[4567.3s - 4571.9s] repelled by India's air defense systems.
[4570.0s - 4573.7s] Now following this, New Delhi launched a
[4571.9s - 4576.6s] counter action carrying out precision
[4573.7s - 4578.5s] strikes deep inside Pakistan striking 11
[4576.6s - 4581.2s] military
[4578.5s - 4582.8s] targets. In Azabaijan, the Pakistani
[4581.2s - 4585.2s] prime minister was referring to these
[4582.8s - 4587.5s] strikes. India's decisive action
[4585.2s - 4590.0s] prompted Pakistan to seek peace with the
[4587.5s - 4592.4s] GM of Pakistan initiating contact with
[4590.0s - 4594.4s] the Indian side and agreeing to halt all
[4592.4s - 4596.8s] firing and military action on land, air,
[4594.4s - 4598.0s] and sea, bringing an end to a three-day
[4596.8s - 4599.8s] long
[4598.0s - 4600.8s] confrontation. All right. We'll of
[4599.8s - 4602.2s] course continue to bring all
[4600.8s - 4604.3s] developments on that front. Let's shift
[4602.2s - 4606.1s] our focus for now. Pakistan's Prime
[4604.3s - 4608.1s] Minister Shba Sharif has admitted to
[4606.1s - 4610.7s] India's precision missile strike on the
[4608.1s - 4613.0s] Nurh Khan air base in Rahul Pindi and
[4610.7s - 4615.4s] other sites. In a statement that has now
[4613.0s - 4617.6s] gone viral on social media, Sharif is
[4615.4s - 4620.4s] heard saying that Pakistan Army Chief
[4617.6s - 4622.2s] Asimir personally called him at 2:30
[4620.4s - 4625.0s] a.m. on the intervening night of the 9th
[4622.2s - 4628.4s] of May and the 10th of May to inform him
[4625.0s - 4628.4s] about the attack.
[4637.5s - 4640.5s] General
[4645.8s - 4652.2s] say
[4648.7s - 4652.2s] Hindustan ballistic
[4652.8s - 4656.9s] missiles report.
[4659.4s - 4663.8s] The Pakistani prime minister made the
[4661.2s - 4666.1s] admission while addressing the Yom
[4663.8s - 4668.8s] Tashakur event in the Pakist at the
[4666.1s - 4671.3s] Pakistan monument in
[4668.8s - 4673.4s] Islamabad. India's counter strike it
[4671.3s - 4676.0s] targeted key Pakistani air bases
[4673.4s - 4679.9s] including Nur Khan, Rahheim Khan,
[4676.0s - 4682.9s] Walari, Jakobabad, Skardu and Saroda.
[4679.9s - 4684.8s] These bases suffered extensive damage as
[4682.9s - 4687.7s] confirmed by satellite images released
[4684.8s - 4690.0s] by the Indian military. Satellite images
[4687.7s - 4692.5s] released by Maxar Technologies confirmed
[4690.0s - 4694.5s] attacks by the Indian armed forces. The
[4692.5s - 4697.0s] damage to Pakistani military facilities
[4694.5s - 4700.1s] have been devastating after crossber
[4697.0s - 4701.7s] strikes from India. Pakistan has made a
[4700.1s - 4703.4s] rare acknowledgement of its military
[4701.7s - 4705.4s] losses. Pakistan's Prime Minister
[4703.4s - 4707.9s] Shabbash Sharif has admitted India's
[4705.4s - 4710.4s] precision missile strikes on the Nurh
[4707.9s - 4712.6s] Khan air base in Rahul Pindi and other
[4710.4s - 4715.0s] sites. The Shabbash Sharif revealed that
[4712.6s - 4717.4s] Pakistan's army chief Aimuner had
[4715.0s - 4719.9s] personally called him at 2:30 a.m. on
[4717.4s - 4722.2s] the intervening night of the 9th of May
[4719.9s - 4725.2s] and 10th to inform him about the attack.
[4722.2s - 4725.2s] Listen.
[4735.0s - 4738.0s] General
[4746.2s - 4753.4s] say, ballistic missiles
[4750.4s - 4753.4s] launch
[4756.4s - 4759.8s] airport as part of operations. In
[4758.4s - 4762.3s] Synindur, the Indian Air Force, the
[4759.8s - 4763.9s] Indian Navy had worked in tandem to
[4762.3s - 4765.7s] strike a terror infrastructure and
[4763.9s - 4768.6s] strategic military installations across
[4765.7s - 4770.5s] Pakistan and Pakistan occupied Kashmir.
[4768.6s - 4771.9s] In the aftermath of operation Synindur,
[4770.5s - 4774.1s] India is of course continuing its fight
[4771.9s - 4776.1s] against Pakistan sponsored terror in its
[4774.1s - 4778.8s] latest crackdown on Pakistani spies and
[4776.1s - 4781.8s] sleeper cells. Six Indian nationals have
[4778.8s - 4783.9s] been arrested for spying for Pakistan.
[4781.8s - 4786.5s] Now those arrested for sharing sensitive
[4783.9s - 4789.2s] information includes a Hanaab based
[4786.5s - 4793.2s] YouTuber and a travel blogger called
[4789.2s - 4795.4s] Joti Malhotra. The 33-year-old YouTuber
[4793.2s - 4798.1s] reportedly ran a travel account named
[4795.4s - 4801.4s] Travel with Joe. She's now been arrested
[4798.1s - 4803.8s] from Hisar in Hana for sharing what has
[4801.4s - 4806.7s] been described as sensitive military
[4803.8s - 4809.4s] information with Pakistan. She allegedly
[4806.7s - 4811.9s] developed close ties with Aasanu Rahman
[4809.4s - 4813.6s] Rahim alias Dhanish a staff member at
[4811.9s - 4816.4s] the Pakistani high commission in New
[4813.6s - 4818.5s] Delhi during her visit to Pakistan. Now
[4816.4s - 4821.1s] the accused is amongst the six people
[4818.5s - 4823.9s] including a 25-year-old student and 24
[4821.1s - 4826.0s] year old security guard from Punjab who
[4823.9s - 4828.5s] had been who have been arrested on these
[4826.0s - 4831.0s] charges. The India has also busted a
[4828.5s - 4833.2s] massive fake SIM racket with Pakistani
[4831.0s - 4836.1s] links under operation
[4833.2s - 4839.7s] ghost sim Indian officials have traced
[4836.1s - 4842.2s] fake SIM card rackets across India and
[4839.7s - 4844.4s] they have so far made seven arrests from
[4842.2s - 4846.7s] three different states. Now India's
[4844.4s - 4848.5s] state investigation agency is currently
[4846.7s - 4851.3s] conducting raids at multiple locations
[4848.5s - 4852.6s] across central and north India. The
[4851.3s - 4854.2s] development follows the recent
[4852.6s - 4857.3s] documented raids that have been carried
[4854.2s - 4860.0s] out by the SIA on the 11th of May
[4857.3s - 4861.5s] targeting approximately 20 locations in
[4860.0s - 4864.5s] South Kashmir specifically in the
[4861.5s - 4867.5s] districts of Pulwama, Chopan, Kulgam and
[4864.5s - 4869.8s] also Anundant
[4867.5s - 4872.2s] and Pakistan Prime Minister Shah Sharif
[4869.8s - 4874.0s] has admitted that he was swimming while
[4872.2s - 4876.6s] India launched precision strikes on
[4874.0s - 4878.5s] Pakistan under operation Sindur. In a
[4876.6s - 4880.8s] statement at an event in Islamabad on
[4878.5s - 4883.4s] Friday, the Pakistan Prime Minister said
[4880.8s - 4885.1s] he received a call from General Sedun
[4883.4s - 4888.0s] around 2:30 a.m. on the intervening
[4885.1s - 4889.8s] night on May 9th and May 10th, adding
[4888.0s - 4891.9s] that he was informed that India's
[4889.8s - 4894.2s] ballistic missiles had hit Nuran air
[4891.9s - 4895.8s] base and other areas. Now, Sharifi
[4894.2s - 4897.7s] further went on to say that he was
[4895.8s - 4902.3s] swimming when he received the secure
[4897.7s - 4902.3s] line call from Army Chief Aimun.
[4920.3s - 4923.3s] foreign.
[4923.5s - 4926.4s] As luck would have
[4931.1s - 4935.6s] it, the controversial statement of
[4933.6s - 4938.0s] Shahbash Sharif inadvertently admitting
[4935.6s - 4940.5s] to the strikes has drawn massive flag
[4938.0s - 4942.0s] from Pakistani citizens on social media.
[4940.5s - 4944.0s] India strikes in retaliation to the
[4942.0s - 4946.7s] Pahelgam terror attack targeted key
[4944.0s - 4949.4s] Pakistani air bases including Nurhan,
[4946.7s - 4951.9s] Rahheim Yar Khan, Balor Jakobabad,
[4949.4s - 4953.5s] Sakadu and Sarugda. Well, as confirmed
[4951.9s - 4955.6s] by satellite images released by the
[4953.5s - 4958.2s] Indian military, the military bases in
[4955.6s - 4960.2s] Pakistan suffered extensive damage.
[4958.2s - 4961.9s] Satellite images released by Maxa
[4960.2s - 4963.9s] Technologies confirmed attacks by the
[4961.9s - 4966.0s] Indian armed forces. The damage to
[4963.9s - 4968.8s] Pakistani military facilities have been
[4966.0s - 4971.5s] devastating after crossber strikes from
[4968.8s - 4973.8s] India. In other news, weeks after India
[4971.5s - 4976.4s] conducted precision military strikes on
[4973.8s - 4979.6s] Pakistan's terror hubs in response to
[4976.4s - 4982.4s] the Pelgam terror attack, Pakistan cries
[4979.6s - 4985.2s] talks again. Pakistan's Prime Minister
[4982.4s - 4989.2s] Shabbaz Sharif has reportedly extended
[4985.2s - 4993.1s] India an olive branch. But going by past
[4989.2s - 4996.9s] experiences, if broken promises at talks
[4993.1s - 4996.9s] and dialogue had a face,
